# Fast-Lane Plan Contract

Loaded by Phase 6 of `/fix-bug` when triage picked `simple` AND
`confidence(analysis) ≥ 92 %`. Defines the minimum `plan.md` shape that
`/fix-bug` must produce — via `Skill("aw-create-plan", ...)` — for
`aw-executor` to consume without `aw-planner` ever running.

The contract exists because `aw-executor` expects a plan.md written to the
autonomous-workflow shape; without aw-planner in the loop, `/fix-bug` is the
author. The structural requirements below match what aw-planner would have
produced, minus the planner's deep architectural analysis (which a simple bug
does not need).

Source: [autonomous-workflow Phase 2 plan-artifact spec](../../autonomous-workflow/SKILL.md)
— the plan.md shape aw-executor reads from.

## When this rule loads

Phase 6 fast-lane only. The complex path uses the existing bug-fix-pack →
aw-planner flow and never touches this rule.

Preconditions checked by Phase 6 step 6a before this rule loads:

1. Phase 0.5 triage classified the bug as `simple`.
2. Phase 4 confidence gate cleared at ≥ 92 %.
3. Phase 2.5 produced a non-best-effort failing reproduction (best-effort
   repros fall back to standard-lane — fast-lane requires a real
   `FAIL_TO_PASS` contract).
4. The worktree does **not** yet exist — `/fix-bug` creates it as part of
   this rule's procedure.

If any precondition fails, route to standard-lane and log the reason.

---

## Required sections

The fast-lane `plan.md` is a **superset of the [`aw-create-plan`](../../aw-create-plan/SKILL.md) Core schema**: every Core section — TL;DR, Requirements, Decisions, Acceptance Criteria, Implementation Order, File Changes, Verification, Progress Log — appears verbatim, plus the bug-specific sections below.
Because every Core section is present by name, the plan satisfies the `aw-create-plan` Core schema, so `aw-executor`'s bail-out check and the `confidence(plan)` deterministic rule checks pass unchanged.

`plan.md` MUST have these sections, in this order (Core sections marked):

1. **Title** — one-line bug summary (matches PR title)
2. **TL;DR** *(Core)* — 3–5 sentences: symptom / root cause / proposed change / done-when
3. **Branch + worktree** — `fix/<slug>` and `.agent/fix/<slug>/`
4. **Requirements** *(Core)* — tagged requirements from the Evidence Record, with an `### Out of Scope` subsection (the explicit do-not-touch list)
5. **Symptom** — verbatim from Evidence Record
6. **Bug class** — from Phase 0
7. **Reproduction** — repro path, command, status
8. **Root cause** — from in-skill lightweight analysis (NOT holistic-analysis)
9. **Decisions** *(Core)* — chosen fix + alternatives rejected + rationale
10. **Proposed change** — file + line + before/after sketch
11. **Acceptance Criteria** *(Core)* — testable done conditions; replaces the former "Done criteria" section name to match the Core schema
12. **Implementation Order** *(Core)* — numbered, atomic executor steps
13. **File Changes** *(Core)* — Action / File / Change / Reason table
14. **Verification** *(Core)* — after-edit and before-PR commands
15. **CEGIS refinement contract** — verbatim (see [Section spec](#section-by-section-spec))
16. **FAIL_TO_PASS contract** — the repro test name + expected failure mode
17. **PASS_TO_PASS contract** — list of test files that must continue to pass
18. **Bug-notes ledger pointer** — path + read/append discipline reminder
19. **Confidence trajectory** — analysis score + breakdown
20. **Progress Log** *(Core)* — append-only; seeded and versioned by `aw-create-plan`

No `plan.vN.md` snapshot is written: the fast lane passes a plan body in the
arg slot, which is `aw-create-plan`'s default (non-snapshot) mode. `plan.md` is
the single file, overwritten in place; its `version:` frontmatter is the
iteration counter.

---

## Section-by-section spec

### 1. Title

```markdown
# Fix: <one-line summary, ≤ 70 chars>
```

The line is the PR title. Use the same phrasing as the bug-notes ledger's
`Symptom` field, compressed.

### 2. TL;DR

```markdown
## TL;DR

<3–5 sentences: (1) the symptom being fixed, (2) the root cause in one
sentence, (3) the proposed change, (4) done when the FAIL_TO_PASS repro
passes and every PASS_TO_PASS suite stays green.>
```

This is the human-review surface the Core schema requires — direction must be agreeable or contestable in under 60 seconds.

### 3. Branch + worktree

```markdown
## Branch + worktree

- Branch: `fix/<slug>`
- Worktree: `.agent/fix/<slug>/`
- Base: `main`
- Created by: `/fix-bug` fast-lane (no aw-planner)
```

### 4. Requirements

```markdown
## Requirements

1. <symptom from the Evidence Record> no longer occurs — [user-stated]
2. All tests listed under PASS_TO_PASS continue to pass — [inferred]

### Out of Scope

The executor must NOT:

- Modify any file outside the affected-files table in the Evidence Record
  without re-running confidence(analysis).
- Modify the repro file under `repro/` to make tests pass — verifier
  rejects this.
- Introduce new dependencies.
- Refactor neighbouring code that wasn't part of the failing path.
```

Tag every requirement `[user-stated]` or `[inferred]` per the Core schema.
Add bug-specific out-of-scope items as needed — the list is the cheap guardrail against scope creep on a "simple" fix.

### 5. Symptom

Copy the Evidence Record's `Symptom` paragraph verbatim. Do not paraphrase —
the verifier (Phase 7) checks this against the Evidence Record.

### 6. Bug class

Single line: `Bug class: <bugClass from Phase 0>`.

### 7. Reproduction

```markdown
## Reproduction

- Path: `repro/<short-id>.<ext>`
- Command: `<exact command>`
- Expected on HEAD (no fix): FAIL because `<one-line reason>`
- Expected after fix: PASS
```

If the repro is best-effort, the precondition check above fails — this
section will never carry a best-effort repro on the fast-lane.

### 8. Root cause

One paragraph, written by `/fix-bug` itself during the simple-path
lightweight analysis (see
[`complexity-triage.md`](./complexity-triage.md#what-simple-actually-skips)).
The shape matches what `holistic-analysis` produces for the complex path:

```markdown
## Root cause

<One paragraph describing what is broken, where, and why the proposed fix
addresses it. Reference the suspect file + line. State one falsifiable
prediction the repro confirms.>
```

The paragraph must include a `Falsifiable prediction:` line — the assertion
the repro is making. If the repro doesn't falsify a prediction, the bug
isn't actually well-understood and triage should not have picked `simple`.

### 9. Decisions

```markdown
## Decisions

| Decision | Alternatives Rejected | Rationale |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| <the chosen minimal fix> | <e.g. revert commit <sha>; broader refactor of <area>> | <why the minimal change satisfies the repro without collateral risk> |
```

At minimum one row: the chosen fix, with the alternatives the lightweight analysis rejected and why.

### 10. Proposed change

```markdown
## Proposed change

### File: `<path>:<line>`

Before:
\`\`\`<lang>
<3–5 lines of current code at the suspect site>
\`\`\`

After:
\`\`\`<lang>
<3–5 lines with the proposed change>
\`\`\`

Why this satisfies the repro:
<one or two sentences linking the change to the failing assertion>
```

For multi-line edits, list each `File` block. The fast-lane is **not**
limited to single-line patches — it's limited to bugs where the change is
**obvious from the suspect site**. A 20-line refactor in one function is
still simple if the cause is contained.

### 11. Acceptance Criteria

Renamed from the former "Done criteria" so the Core schema's section name appears verbatim — same content.

> **Intentionally un-IDed.** Fast-lane criteria carry no `AC-{n}` IDs and no
> `(covers: R{m})` annotations — that is the documented marker that opts a plan
> out of `confidence(plan)` rules #9/#11 (which never run on the fast-lane
> anyway; the ≥ 92 % `confidence(analysis)` gate is the substitute) and out of
> `checks.yaml` emission. The CEGIS refinement contract + FAIL_TO_PASS /
> PASS_TO_PASS contracts already fill the executable-check role for a bug fix.
> Do not "upgrade" this section to the IDed format without also emitting
> `checks.yaml` — half-adopting the format would trip rule #11's ID-sync check
> if a future lane ever routes through `confidence(plan)`.

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] FAIL_TO_PASS test passes.
- [ ] All PASS_TO_PASS tests/suites pass.
- [ ] The diff touches only files listed in the affected-files table (plus
      the commit message + PR description).
- [ ] Bug-notes ledger has been appended with Phase 6 fast-lane events
      (worktree creation, CEGIS rounds, final patch summary).

Executor opens the draft PR when every criterion is checked.
Verifier (Phase 7) decides undraft. Executor does NOT undraft.
```

### 12. Implementation Order

```markdown
## Implementation Order

1. Apply the proposed change at `<path>:<line>`.
2. Run the repro per the CEGIS refinement contract.
3. Run every PASS_TO_PASS test/suite.
4. Append the CEGIS round results to the bug-notes ledger.
```

Keep steps atomic and bug-specific — add one step per `File` block when the proposed change spans multiple files.

### 13. File Changes

```markdown
## File Changes

| Action | File   | Change                          | Reason                          |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| modify | <path> | <one-line change description>   | <link to the root cause>        |
```

Every file listed here must also appear in the Evidence Record's affected-files table — the Out of Scope rule and the verifier's diff-sanity check both key off that table.

### 14. Verification

```markdown
## Verification

- **After editing**: `<repro command>` (the FAIL_TO_PASS check)
- **Before PR**: `<project test command covering the PASS_TO_PASS suites>`
```

### 15. CEGIS refinement contract

Verbatim from [`bug-fix-pack.md`](../templates/bug-fix-pack.md) — same
3-round cap, same counterexample-append discipline. The aw-executor's
contract does not change between lanes.

```markdown
## CEGIS refinement contract

After each implementation edit:

1. Run the repro at `<path>` with `<command>`.
2. On PASS: continue to PASS_TO_PASS checks.
3. On FAIL: capture the failing input/output verbatim, append to
   `.agent/<branch>/bug-notes.md` under `Counterexamples`, refine the patch
   using the captured input as evidence, and re-run.
4. Cap at **3 refinement rounds**. After the third FAIL, stop refining and
   trigger the fast-lane round-3 fallback in
   [`autonomous-handoff.md`](./autonomous-handoff.md#fast-lane-round-3-fallback) —
   do NOT keep guessing.
```

### 16. FAIL_TO_PASS contract

```markdown
## FAIL_TO_PASS

- Test: `<repro path>::<test name>`
- Pre-fix: MUST FAIL with `<exact assertion or error message>`
- Post-fix: MUST PASS
- Verifier (Phase 7) re-runs this in a fresh context.
```

### 17. PASS_TO_PASS contract

```markdown
## PASS_TO_PASS

The following test files must continue to pass after the fix:

- `<test file 1>`
- `<test file 2>`
- …
```

The list is derived from the **affected files** in the Evidence Record:
every test that imports a changed file is a PASS_TO_PASS candidate. If the
test count exceeds 10, list the *suites* that must pass rather than
individual files — the executor expands suites at run time.

### 18. Bug-notes ledger pointer

```markdown
## Bug-notes ledger

- Path: `.agent/<branch>/bug-notes.md`
- Discipline: read on entry, append on exit. Append-only. See
  [`bug-notes-ledger.md`](./bug-notes-ledger.md).
- The ledger already contains: Phase 0 intake, Phase 0.5 triage, Phase 1
  evidence + pre-flight, Phase 2 Evidence Record + repro, Phase 4 confidence
  trajectory.
```

### 19. Confidence trajectory

```markdown
## Confidence (analysis)

- Evidence strength: <X%>
- Root cause certainty: <X%>
- Fix confidence: <X%>
- **Overall: <X%>** — cleared the ≥ 92 % fast-lane gate at Phase 4.
```

### 20. Progress Log

```markdown
## Progress Log

- [<TIMESTAMP>] Phase 6 (fast-lane): plan.v1.md created by /fix-bug via aw-create-plan
```

`aw-create-plan` seeds this section; every later milestone (executor takeover, CEGIS rounds, phase transitions) appends per the Core schema's append-only contract.
Timestamps use full ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`).

---

## Worktree + invocation sequence

`/fix-bug` performs these steps in order — this **is** the fast-lane Phase 6
procedure that [`autonomous-handoff.md`](./autonomous-handoff.md#fast-lane)
references.

1. **Create the worktree.** Prefer `gw checkout fix/<slug>` when the `gw`
   CLI is available; otherwise use plain
   `git worktree add -b fix/<slug> .agent/fix/<slug>` from the main checkout.
   Capture the worktree path; it is `.agent/fix/<slug>/`.

2. **Move the bug-notes ledger.** If the ledger was initialised under the
   pre-worktree slug, copy it to `.agent/fix/<slug>/bug-notes.md` and update
   the canonical path. Append a `Phase 6 lane: fast-lane` entry.

3. **Invoke `aw-create-plan`.** Pass the fast-lane plan content in the
   skill prompt:

   ```text
   Skill("aw-create-plan", "<full plan.md body per this contract>")
   ```

   `aw-create-plan` writes `.agent/fix/<slug>/plan.md` (default mode — a plan
   body in the arg slot is not the `snapshot` flag, so no `plan.vN.md` snapshot
   is written). It does NOT validate the plan body against this contract — that
   responsibility stays with `/fix-bug`.

4. **Validate the plan.md** — re-read the file and confirm all 20 required
   sections (the 8 Core sections plus the bug-specific ones) are present per
   the [Required sections](#required-sections) list. If any are missing, fail
   with a clear error and do NOT dispatch the executor. The bug-notes ledger
   captures the failure.

5. **Dispatch `aw-executor`.** Use the Agent tool with
   `subagent_type: "aw-executor"` and `isolation: "worktree"` pointing at
   `.agent/fix/<slug>/`. Minimal prompt:

   ```text
   Execute the plan at .agent/fix/<slug>/plan.md in the current worktree.
   This plan was authored directly by /fix-bug (fast-lane); aw-planner did
   not run. The CEGIS refinement contract in the plan is binding.
   ```

   If the harness's Agent tool does not support the `isolation` parameter,
   omit it — the worktree already exists from step 1; the prompt's worktree
   path is the isolation contract.

6. **Return to** [`autonomous-handoff.md` step 6c](./autonomous-handoff.md#step-6c--report-back)
   for the status report.

---

## What the contract intentionally omits

These sections appear in the standard-lane bug-fix-pack but are NOT required
on the fast-lane:

| Omitted section | Why |
|------------------|-----|
| Architectural analysis | A simple bug by definition does not have one — the suspect site is the architecture. |
| Cross-module dependency map | Same reason; the affected-files table covers the scope. |
| Migration / backwards-compat plan | A null check or off-by-one doesn't migrate anything. |
| Rollout staging | The executor's draft-PR + verifier flow is the rollout. |
| Documentation update plan | If docs need updating, that is `complex` by definition — triage should have caught it. |

If the lightweight analysis surfaces any of these as needed, **escalate to
standard-lane** — that is the signal the bug was not actually simple.

---

## Hard invariants

The diagnoser at [`/create-skill diagnose fix-bug`](../../../authoring/create-skill/SKILL.md#diagnose-workflow)
must not propose to relax any of these without explicit user confirmation:

- **Fast-lane requires confidence ≥ 92 %.** The threshold is the substitute
  for aw-planner's `confidence(plan) ≥ 90 %` gate that fast-lane bypasses.
  Lowering the threshold without re-introducing planner would leave only two
  independent confidence gates instead of three.
- **Fast-lane requires a non-best-effort repro.** The repro IS the
  executor's contract; without it, there's nothing to gate CEGIS on.
- **`/fix-bug` validates plan.md before dispatching the executor.** The
  contract is unenforced if the validator step is skipped.
- **Round-3 CEGIS failure on fast-lane falls back to standard-lane.** The
  fallback is the safety net for "triage classified simple but the bug
  wasn't." See [`autonomous-handoff.md`](./autonomous-handoff.md#fast-lane-round-3-fallback).
- **The verifier (Phase 7) is identical for both lanes.** Fresh context,
  same four checks, only the verifier may undraft. No lane-specific
  loosening.
