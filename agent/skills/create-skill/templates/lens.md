## Trigger

<1–3 lines: when this lens should fire. Echo `applies-to` for humans and
add diff-shape context the glob can't express. Example: "Fires when the
diff touches Anthropic SDK calls or any file named `*-prompt.ts`.">

## Checklist

<!-- Each item: single sentence, falsifiable from a diff hunk, ends with a verb. -->
