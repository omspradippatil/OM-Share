# Anti-Patterns

Refuse to emit any of these.
If the user explicitly asks for one, explain the consequence and offer
the canonical alternative.

## Story files

| Anti-pattern                                                                 | Why it is wrong                                                                        | Do instead                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual stories + interaction tests in the same file.                         | CSF3 allows one default export — title applies to all stories.                         | Two files: `<x>.stories.tsx` + `<x>.test.stories.tsx`.                |
| Interaction file named `*.interactions.stories.tsx` or `*.spec.stories.tsx`. | Repo convention is `.test.stories.tsx`. Inconsistency confuses test runners and globs. | Rename to `*.test.stories.tsx`.                                       |
| `args`-only `Default` story.                                                 | Hard to extend with a `play` function later; each variant becomes a separate snapshot. | `StoryObj` with a `render` function grouping variants.                |
| Dynamic values in args (`new Date()`, `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`).        | Guaranteed false positives in any pixel-diff tool (Chromatic, Loki).                   | Static ISO strings, static IDs, static numbers.                       |
| `Math.random()` IDs in mock data.                                            | Same problem — re-renders produce a new pixel.                                         | Static strings: `"user-1"`, `"item-abc"`.                             |
| Skipping the locator ladder; reaching for `getByTestId` first.               | Couples the test to source structure; weakens accessibility coverage.                  | `getByRole` → `getByLabelText` → `getByText` → `getByTestId`.         |
| `accessibilityLabel` used as a test selector on native.                      | Doubles assistive-tech metadata as test infra; one change breaks both.                 | Use `testID` for tests; keep `accessibilityLabel` for screen readers. |

## `play` functions

| Anti-pattern                                                      | Why it is wrong                                                        | Do instead                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Un-awaited `userEvent.click(...)`.                                | Flake. Storybook's Interactions panel logs the wrong order.            | `await userEvent.click(...)`.                                |
| Un-awaited `expect(...)`.                                         | Same flake risk. Race between assertion and re-render.                 | `await expect(...)`.                                         |
| Imports from `@testing-library/*` or `vitest` directly.           | Bypasses Storybook's auto-reset of `fn()` and step instrumentation.    | Import from `"storybook/test"`.                              |
| `.only` or `.skip` left on a story.                               | Silently disables sibling tests in the runner.                         | Remove before commit. CI should fail if either is present.   |
| Catch-all `try { … } catch {}` around the play body.              | Swallows assertion failures; the runner sees a "pass" that wasn't one. | Let the play function throw. The runner reports the failure. |
| Composing `play` by calling `Story.play({ canvasElement })` only. | The play API expects the full context (`step`, `args`).                | Pass the full context: `await Other.play!(context)`.         |

## Auth

| Anti-pattern                                                   | Why it is wrong                                                     | Do instead                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credentials in `.env`, `package.json`, or any committed file.  | Leaks the secret into git history forever.                          | OS keychain via [`rules/auth.md`](./auth.md).                             |
| Logging the password to the terminal during the login flow.    | Leaks into shell history, CI logs, and any terminal-recording tool. | Read from keychain in-process; pass directly to `page.fill`.              |
| One `auth.config.json` per machine.                            | Breaks team collaboration; profiles drift.                          | One config file per repo; keychain holds the per-machine secret.          |
| Storing `storageState.json` outside `.agent/storybook/.auth/`. | Easy to accidentally commit; harder to gitignore selectively.       | Always under `.agent/storybook/.auth/` with the dir in `.gitignore`.      |
| Reusing one keychain service name across multiple profiles.    | A `delete` removes the wrong profile's secret.                      | `agent-skills.storybook.<repo-slug>.<profile-name>` — unique per profile. |

## Playwright CLI

| Anti-pattern                                                            | Why it is wrong                                                                                              | Do instead                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Headed mode (`playwright open`) in CI.                                  | Requires a display server. CI containers do not have one.                                                    | Headless `playwright screenshot` in CI; headed only locally for debugging. |
| Installing Playwright silently when it is missing.                      | Heavy dependency; downloads browsers; the user may not want it.                                              | Halt, ask, install only with permission.                                   |
| Leaving the background Storybook process running after the skill exits. | Stale port. Stale resources. Confuses the next agent run.                                                    | Track the PID; kill on exit.                                               |
| Iterating more than twice against the same failing story.               | Diminishing returns. By round 3 the premise (selector, story id, auth) is almost always wrong, not the impl. | Cap at two; escalate via `confidence(analysis)`.                           |

## Workflow

| Anti-pattern                                                                 | Why it is wrong                                                                                                                                                              | Do instead                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scaffolding stories before the component exists.                             | The skill needs to read prop types and variants.                                                                                                                             | Refuse. Ask the user to point at an existing component.                                                                             |
| Generating an `argTypes` set that does not match the component's prop types. | Storybook Controls then crash; users lose trust in the Playground.                                                                                                           | Read the component's `interface`; mirror exactly.                                                                                   |
| Skipping Phase 0 preflight and assuming Storybook is installed.              | Some repos have Storybook in a workspace package and not the root.                                                                                                           | Always run the preflight; halt if `.storybook/` is missing.                                                                         |
| Treating the Storybook test runner as optional.                              | Without it, interaction tests never run in CI.                                                                                                                               | If `test-storybook` is not wired up, propose adding it (separate PR).                                                               |
| Renaming `meta.title` on an existing story file.                             | Every Chromatic / Loki baseline is keyed by the story id derived from the title — the rename orphans them all and the next CI run pays for fresh baselines on every variant. | Warn before renaming. If renaming is genuinely required, mention it explicitly in the PR description and accept the baseline reset. |
