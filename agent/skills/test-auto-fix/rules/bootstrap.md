Bootstrap runs when no surface file exists for the current project.
Its job: detect the test stack, propose a surface file diff, wait for user
approval, then write the file.

Bootstrap does NOT run the tests. It only creates the surface file that tells
the skill how to run the tests on subsequent invocations.

## When bootstrap runs

In Phase 0 of [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md), after the project key is computed
and the surface file is confirmed absent.

## Step 1 — Compute the project key

Per [`project-keying.md`](./project-keying.md).
The key becomes the filename: `surfaces/<project-key>.md`.

## Step 2 — Detect the stack

Look for these files in the project root (and common subdirectories):

| Stack | Detection signal |
| --- | --- |
| **Vitest** | `vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.config.js`, `vitest.config.mts`, or `"vitest"` in `package.json` devDependencies |
| **Jest** | `jest.config.ts`, `jest.config.js`, `jest.config.cjs`, or `"jest"` in `package.json` devDependencies |
| **Deno** | `deno.json`, `deno.jsonc`, or `deno.lock` present |
| **Playwright** | `playwright.config.ts`, `playwright.config.js`, or `"@playwright/test"` in devDependencies |
| **Pytest** | `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, `setup.cfg` with `[tool:pytest]`, or `pytest` in `requirements*.txt` |
| **Maestro** | `.maestro/` directory or `*.yaml` files with Maestro `appId:` keys |
| **Storybook** | `.storybook/` directory AND (`"@storybook/addon-vitest"` or `"@storybook/test-runner"`) in devDependencies |

Read `package.json` (or `pyproject.toml`, `deno.json`) to confirm detection.
For JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos, check the root AND all `apps/*/package.json` files.

### Dominant stack selection

If multiple stacks are detected:

1. Prefer the stack that has the most test files (glob `**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*`).
2. If Storybook is detected alongside Vitest or Jest, create separate surfaces:
   one for unit tests and one for Storybook interaction tests.
3. Note all detected stacks in the surface file's free-text Notes section.

## Step 3 — Load the detector template

Load the matching detector:

- Vitest → [`../detectors/vitest.md`](../detectors/vitest.md)
- Jest → [`../detectors/jest.md`](../detectors/jest.md)
- Deno → [`../detectors/deno.md`](../detectors/deno.md)
- Playwright → [`../detectors/playwright.md`](../detectors/playwright.md)
- Pytest → [`../detectors/pytest.md`](../detectors/pytest.md)
- Maestro → [`../detectors/maestro.md`](../detectors/maestro.md)
- Storybook → [`../detectors/storybook.md`](../detectors/storybook.md)

## Step 4 — Customize the template

Fill in the template's placeholder values based on the detected project:

- `project-key` — from Step 1.
- `detect-command` — from the project's `package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, or Nx targets (if present).
  Prefer the project's own canonical test command over a raw runner invocation.
  Example: if `package.json` has `"test": "vitest run"`, use that form.
- `single-test-command` — infer from the detect command. Most runners accept a file path and `-t "<name>"`.
- `failure-parser` — use the stack's canonical regex from the detector file.
  Adjust if the project uses a custom reporter that changes the output format.
- `cache-bust-flag` — include if the detect command goes through a caching layer (Nx, Turborepo, Bazel).

## Step 5 — Propose the surface diff and wait for approval

Render the proposal block exactly per [`../templates/bootstrap-proposal.md`](../templates/bootstrap-proposal.md).
The template is the canonical user-facing format; do not improvise the wording.

**Do NOT write the file until the user confirms.**
If the user provides corrections, apply them and show the updated content before writing.

## Step 6 — Write the surface file (atomic)

After approval, write the file atomically to avoid corruption when two
`test-auto-fix` runs touch the same surface concurrently (parallel CI workers,
interactive + agent session against the same repo):

1. Create the `surfaces/` directory if it does not exist.
2. Write to a temporary sibling first, then rename:
   ```bash
   tmp="surfaces/<project-key>.md.tmp.$$"
   # write content to "$tmp" with the Write tool
   mv -n "$tmp" "surfaces/<project-key>.md"
   ```
   `mv -n` (no-clobber) refuses to overwrite if another worker already wrote the
   target between Step 5's check and Step 6's rename. If the rename is refused,
   re-read the now-existing surface and re-validate per
   [`surface-validation.md`](./surface-validation.md) instead of writing.
3. Confirm:
   ```text
   Surface written: surfaces/<project-key>.md
   Proceeding to Phase 1.
   ```

## Edge cases

| Edge case | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| No stack detected | Ask the user which stack to use; fall back to `templates/surface.md` as a blank template |
| Multiple monorepo packages with different stacks | Create one surface per package; name them `<project-key>-<package>.md` |
| Private registry / custom runner | Fill `detect-command` with a placeholder and tell the user to complete it |
| `--surface <path>` passed | Skip bootstrap entirely; use the provided file directly |
