## Overview

Recovery procedures for common errors during autonomous execution. Don't give
up on errors — diagnose and recover. Where a companion skill is unavailable
or a stuck-loop trips, the workflow has explicit fallback paths so it never
gets stuck silently.

## Worktree Creation Failures

**Error:** `gw add` or `git worktree add` fails

| Cause                 | Fix (with `gw`)                        | Fix (native `git worktree`)                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Branch already exists | Use different name or `gw cd <branch>` | `git worktree list` to inspect, then `cd` into the existing path or pick a new branch name |
| Permission error      | Check directory permissions            | Check directory permissions on `../<repo>-<branch-slug>`      |
| Disk space issue      | Run `gw prune`, free space             | `git worktree prune`, free space                              |
| Path collision        | Pick a different branch name           | `git worktree list` shows occupied paths; pick a different branch slug |
| Git error             | Read message, fix underlying issue     | Read message, fix underlying issue                            |

If `gw` is not installed at all, that is **not** a failure — it's the expected
native fallback. See
[prerequisites#fallback-to-native-git-worktree](./prerequisites.md#fallback-to-native-git-worktree).

## Dependency Installation Failures

**Error:** `npm install` (or equivalent) fails

| Cause                   | Fix                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Network error           | Check connection, try different registry     |
| Version incompatibility | Check node requirements, switch version      |
| Lock file mismatch      | Delete lock file and `node_modules`, reinstall |
| Disk space              | Clean cache (`npm cache clean --force`)      |

---

## Test Failures During Iteration

See [phase-4-testing](./phase-4-testing.md) for the full iteration strategy.

**Quick reference (mode-aware cap: 3 Lite Mode / 5 Full Mode):**

| Iteration       | Action                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1               | Read error, fix the most likely cause                        |
| 2 … cap − 1     | Re-read error in light of prior attempts; adjust mental model |
| cap (3 or 5)    | Stop iterating. Run `Skill("confidence", "analysis")` and follow the Phase 4 auto-replan protocol |

After the mode's cap on the same failing area, **stop guessing**. Token spend
beyond this rarely converges.

---

## Stuck-Loop Hit at the Cap

**Detection:** Same failing test or area attempted up to the mode-aware cap
(3 iterations in Lite Mode / 5 in Full Mode) without resolution.

**Recovery (mandatory):**

1. Run `Skill("confidence", "analysis")` to root-cause the failure.
2. If the score is < 90% and the one-shot auto-replan has not yet been used:
   run `Skill("holistic-analysis")`, regenerate the affected `plan.md` sections
   via `aw-create-plan`, reset the counter, set `auto_replan_used`, and resume
   the Phase 4 loop once more (the [auto-replan protocol](./phase-4-testing.md#stuck-loop-detection)).
3. Otherwise (score ≥ 90%, or auto-replan already used), append to `plan.md`
   Progress Log a one-line summary of each prior attempt plus the confidence
   findings, then present to the user:
   - The attempts (what was tried, why each failed — pre- and post-replan)
   - Confidence findings (root cause, blocked assumptions)
   - Three options: **continue** with new approach / **try a different angle**
     (e.g. holistic-analysis) / **stop and hand back**
4. Wait for user response. **Never auto-continue past the mode's cap, except
   the single automatic re-plan permitted by the Phase 4 auto-replan protocol.**

If the user asks for a fresh analysis, invoke
`Skill("holistic-analysis")` to step back and re-trace the execution path
end-to-end before attempting again.

---

## Companion Skill Not Available

**Detection:** A companion skill is invoked but isn't installed in this
project (Claude returns an error from the Skill tool).

**Recovery:**

1. Log one line in the conversation:
   `companion: <name> — not available, continuing`
2. Append the same line to `plan.md` Progress Log (Full Mode).
3. Continue the workflow. **Never block on a missing companion.**

The only companion that cannot be skipped is `confidence` at Phase 1 (the plan
gate). If `confidence` itself is unavailable, stop and ask the user to
install it before continuing.

## Build Failures

| Cause              | Fix                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript error   | Fix type issues, add missing types        |
| Missing dependency | Install missing package                   |
| Path/import error  | Check file locations, fix imports         |
| Config error       | Review build config, restore working copy |

---

## CI Failures (Phase 7)

When CI runs complete with status `failure`:

1. Identify the failed checks (`gh pr checks <pr>`).
2. For each independent failure, invoke `Skill("ci-auto-fix", "<run-id|pr-url>")`.
3. Up to 2 parallel `ci-auto-fix` handoffs per PR (see
   [parallel-coordination](./parallel-coordination.md)).
4. If `ci-auto-fix` is not installed: log
   `companion: ci-auto-fix — not available, continuing` and surface the failed
   checks to the user with reproduction commands.

See [phase-7-ci-gate](./phase-7-ci-gate.md) for details.

## Agent-Specific Recovery

### Hallucinated Commands

| Hallucinated Command | Correct Command (with `gw`) | Correct Command (native `git worktree`)            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `gw create`          | `gw checkout` or `gw add`   | `git worktree add -b <branch> <path>`              |
| `gw switch`          | `gw cd`                     | `cd <worktree-path>` (manual)                      |
| `gw delete`          | `gw remove`                 | `git worktree remove <path>` then `git branch -d <branch>` |
| `gw new`             | `gw checkout`               | `git worktree add -b <branch> <path>`              |

### Stuck in Loop

**Detection:** Same fix attempted up to the mode's cap without progress
(covered above under "Stuck-Loop Hit at the Cap").

### Context Loss

**Detection:** Agent re-does completed work or asks already-answered questions.

**Recovery:**

1. Read `.agent/{branch}/plan.md` for full context (decisions, progress,
   requirements).
2. Check Progress Log for what's been completed and which companions ran.
3. Resume from where the log left off.
