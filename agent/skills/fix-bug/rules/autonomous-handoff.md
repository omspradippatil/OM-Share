# Autonomous Handoff

Loads when Phase 5 of `/fix-bug` cleared at >= 92 % (or the user
force-proceeded after 70–91 %). Dispatches the autonomous-workflow agents to
ship the fix as a draft PR.

There are **two lanes**, picked by the Phase 0.5 complexity triage and
confirmed at Phase 5:

| Lane | Trigger | Path |
|------|---------|------|
| [Fast-lane](#fast-lane) | triage = `simple` AND confidence ≥ 92 % AND non-best-effort repro | `/fix-bug` → `aw-create-plan` → `aw-executor` (no aw-planner) |
| [Standard-lane](#standard-lane) | triage = `complex` (default) OR fast-lane preconditions not met OR force-proceed used | `/fix-bug` → `aw-planner` → `aw-executor` (current canonical path) |

Both lanes share Phase 7 (independent verification) and Phase 8 (telemetry
verification) unchanged.

## Lane selection

At the entry of Phase 6, read the bug-notes ledger and pick the lane:

1. If `Complexity triage → Phase 6 lane (provisional) = standard-lane` → use
   [Standard-lane](#standard-lane).
2. If `Complexity triage → Phase 6 lane (provisional) = fast-lane`:
   - Re-check the fast-lane preconditions (see
     [`fast-lane-plan-contract.md`](./fast-lane-plan-contract.md#when-this-rule-loads)).
   - If all hold → use [Fast-lane](#fast-lane).
   - If any fail → downgrade to [Standard-lane](#standard-lane); log the
     downgrade reason in the ledger.
3. If the user force-proceeded after 70–91 % confidence (Phase 5) → always
   [Standard-lane](#standard-lane), regardless of triage. The planner's
   `confidence(plan)` gate is the extra safety net when analysis
   confidence is marginal.

Print one line:

```text
Phase 6 lane: fast-lane | standard-lane (reason: <triage | downgrade <signal> | force-proceed>)
```

## Fast-lane

Triggers when triage said `simple` AND the four preconditions in
[`fast-lane-plan-contract.md`](./fast-lane-plan-contract.md#when-this-rule-loads)
all hold. `/fix-bug` becomes the plan author; `aw-planner` does not run.

### Step 6a (fast) — Create worktree + plan.md

1. **Create the worktree** using `gw checkout fix/<slug>`. Capture path as
   `.agent/fix/<slug>/`.
2. **Move the bug-notes ledger** into the worktree if it was initialised
   under a pre-worktree slug. Append `Phase 6 lane: fast-lane` to the ledger.
3. **Compose the plan body** following every required section in
   [`fast-lane-plan-contract.md`](./fast-lane-plan-contract.md#section-by-section-spec).
4. **Invoke `aw-create-plan`**:

   ```text
   Skill("aw-create-plan", "<full plan.md body>")
   ```

   This writes `.agent/fix/<slug>/plan.md`. The arg is a plan body, not the
   `snapshot` mode flag, so `aw-create-plan` runs in default mode and writes
   **no** `plan.vN.md` snapshot (the fast lane does not need one).
5. **Validate plan.md** — re-read the file and confirm all 20 required
   sections (the 8 `aw-create-plan` Core sections plus the bug-specific ones,
   per [`fast-lane-plan-contract.md`](./fast-lane-plan-contract.md#required-sections))
   are present. On any missing section, fail loudly, log to the ledger, and
   stop. Do NOT dispatch the executor against an under-specified plan.

### Step 6b (fast) — Dispatch `aw-executor`

Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "aw-executor"` and
`isolation: "worktree"` pointing at `.agent/fix/<slug>/`. Minimal prompt:

```text
Execute the plan at .agent/fix/<slug>/plan.md in the current worktree.

This plan was authored directly by /fix-bug (fast-lane); aw-planner did not
run. The CEGIS refinement contract in the plan is binding. On round-3
failure, the orchestrator (/fix-bug) handles the fallback — do not retry
beyond 3 rounds.
```

If the harness's Agent tool does not support the `isolation` parameter, omit
it — the worktree already exists from Step 6a (fast); the prompt's worktree
path is the isolation contract.

The executor runs autonomous-workflow Phases 3–7 (implement, test, document,
draft PR, watch CI). Do not wait for CI to finish before reporting back —
the executor owns CI watching.

### Fast-lane round-3 fallback

The CEGIS contract caps at 3 refinement rounds for both lanes. On the
standard-lane, round-3 failure escalates to `confidence(analysis fix)`
and the existing branch-decision tiers. On the **fast-lane**, round-3
failure additionally **re-dispatches via aw-planner with the captured
counterexamples**, because round-3 failure is the strongest signal the bug
was not actually simple.

Procedure when `aw-executor` reports `CEGIS round 3 failed`:

1. **Read the bug-notes ledger** — every counterexample captured during the
   3 fast-lane rounds is already there under `Counterexamples`.
2. **Append a triage upgrade** to the ledger:

   ```markdown
   ## Triage upgrade

   - Trigger: fast-lane CEGIS round 3 failure
   - New classification: complex
   - Lane: standard-lane (via fallback)
   - Counterexamples to carry forward: <list of round 1–3 capture entries>
   ```

3. **Compose a standard-lane bug-fix-pack** per
   [`templates/bug-fix-pack.md`](../templates/bug-fix-pack.md), with two
   modifications:
   - The `Root cause` section now reads "Fast-lane lightweight analysis
     produced `<original root cause>`; CEGIS rounds 1–3 falsified this.
     Re-analyse with the captured counterexamples."
   - A new `Counterexamples` section embeds the round 1–3 captures verbatim.
4. **Dispatch `aw-planner`** per the standard-lane Step 6a (std) below,
   pointed at the **same worktree** the fast-lane created. The planner
   re-runs validation + planning + its own `confidence(plan)` gate against
   the enriched evidence.
5. If `aw-planner` returns "Below gate", surface its concerns and stop —
   round-3 fallback does not loop further.

The fallback is **single-shot** — there is no fast-lane round-4 and no
second fallback. After fallback, the flow is identical to standard-lane.

---

## Standard-lane

The canonical path. Used for `complex` bugs, downgrades from fast-lane, and
all force-proceed cases. Identical to the pre-upgrade Phase 6.

### Step 6a (std) — Spawn `aw-planner`

Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "aw-planner"` and
`isolation: "worktree"`. Pass the **Bug Fix Pack** from
[`templates/bug-fix-pack.md`](../templates/bug-fix-pack.md), filled in from
the Evidence Record (Phase 2) and holistic-analysis output (Phase 3).
If the harness does not support the `isolation` parameter, omit it — the
planner creates and enters the worktree itself as part of its Phase 2.

The planner runs autonomous-workflow Phases 0–2 (validation, planning,
worktree + `plan.md`), gated by its own internal `confidence(plan) >= 90 %`.
It returns one of:

| Result | Meaning | Next |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Plan ready** | Worktree created, `plan.md` cleared the gate. | Proceed to Step 6b (std). |
| **Below gate** | Confidence < 90 % after retries; concerns surfaced. | Stop. Present concerns. Do not auto-dispatch the executor. |

### Step 6b (std) — Spawn `aw-executor`

Only if Step 6a (std) returned **Plan ready**.

Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "aw-executor"` and
`isolation: "worktree"` pointing at the **same worktree the planner used**.
Minimal prompt:

```text
Execute the plan at .agent/<branch>/plan.md in the current worktree.
```

If the harness does not support the `isolation` parameter, omit it and ensure
the worktree exists (the planner created it in Step 6a; create it manually
with `git worktree add` only if it is somehow missing) — then name the
worktree path explicitly in the prompt.

The executor runs autonomous-workflow Phases 3–7 (implement, test, document,
draft PR, watch CI). Do not wait for CI to finish before reporting back —
the executor owns CI watching.

---

## Step 6c — CEGIS refinement contract

Identical for both lanes. Every plan.md (whether authored by `aw-planner` on
the standard-lane or by `aw-create-plan` on the fast-lane) includes the
contract verbatim. After each executor edit:

1. Run the repro. If it passes, continue to other test runs.
2. If it fails: capture the failing input/output verbatim, append to
   `.agent/<branch>/bug-notes.md` under `Counterexamples`, then refine the
   patch using the captured input as concrete evidence.
3. Cap at **3 refinement rounds**. After the third failure, stop refining.
   - On **standard-lane**: return to `confidence(analysis fix)` for
     re-analysis rather than guessing further.
   - On **fast-lane**: trigger the
     [fast-lane round-3 fallback](#fast-lane-round-3-fallback) — re-dispatch
     via aw-planner with the captured counterexamples.

## Step 6c — Report back

Print the final status block. Same shape for both lanes; the `Lane` row
distinguishes them.

```markdown
## Fix-bug result

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | <Dash0 link / stack trace / code pointer> |
| Lane | fast-lane | standard-lane (downgrade <reason>) | standard-lane (force-proceed) |
| Root cause | <one line> |
| Confidence (analysis) | <X%> |
| Plan confidence | <Y%> if standard-lane, "n/a (fast-lane)" otherwise |
| PR | <url> (draft — verifier pending) |
| Branch | fix/<slug> |
| Worktree | .agent/fix/<slug>/ |
| CI | watching (aw-executor still running) |
```

Do **not** undraft the PR here — that is Phase 7 (independent verification)'s
decision after the executor completes.

## Failure modes

| Failure | Lane | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| `aw-planner` returns "Below gate" | standard | Stop. Present the planner's concerns. Offer: refine (re-spawn planner), force-proceed (NOT recommended, only if user explicitly requests), or abandon. |
| `aw-planner` returns an error (tool / worktree creation failed) | standard | Surface the error. Do not retry silently — worktree state may be inconsistent. |
| `aw-executor` fails before opening a PR | both | Report the worktree path and the failure. The user can resume from the worktree manually or re-spawn the executor. |
| `aw-executor` opens a PR but CI fails immediately | both | The executor handles its own CI gate (Phase 7). Do not intervene from this skill. |
| Fast-lane plan.md validation fails (missing section) | fast | Stop. Log to the ledger. Do NOT dispatch the executor. Offer: re-author the plan, or downgrade to standard-lane. |
| Fast-lane CEGIS round 3 failure | fast | [Fast-lane round-3 fallback](#fast-lane-round-3-fallback). Single-shot — no further loops. |
| Fast-lane preconditions fail at Phase 6 entry (e.g. repro turned best-effort late) | fast | Downgrade to standard-lane silently; log the downgrade reason. The user does not need to intervene. |
| `aw-create-plan` returns an error (worktree missing, branch detection failed) | fast | Surface the error. Worktree state may be inconsistent — do NOT retry blindly. |
