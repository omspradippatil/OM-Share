# Multi-Agentic System Threat Modeling

Conduct comprehensive threat modeling for multi-agent systems using the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) MAESTRO framework's 7-layer architecture and OWASP Multi-Agentic System Threat Modeling Guide v1.0.

## Steps

1. **MAESTRO 7-Layer Architecture Mapping** — Decompose the system into CSA's layered reference architecture:
   - **Layer 7: Agent Ecosystem** — User-facing applications, agent marketplace, business integrations
   - **Layer 6: Security & Compliance** — Cross-cutting security controls, compliance frameworks
   - **Layer 5: Evaluation & Observability** — Monitoring, metrics, anomaly detection, performance tracking
   - **Layer 4: Deployment & Infrastructure** — Containers, orchestration, cloud/on-premise resources
   - **Layer 3: Agent Frameworks** — Orchestration logic, agent-tool bindings, routing decisions
   - **Layer 2: Data Operations** — Memory stores, vector databases, RAG pipelines, context management
   - **Layer 1: Foundation Models** — Core LLMs, model APIs, inference engines

2. **Layer-Specific Threat Analysis** — Identify threats unique to each MAESTRO layer using CSA taxonomy.

3. **Cross-Layer Threat Assessment** — Analyze attack chains that span multiple layers (supply chain attacks, lateral movement, privilege escalation, data leakage cascades).

4. **Extended Multi-Agent Threats** — Apply MAESTRO framework extensions for complex multi-agent scenarios:
   - **Reasoning Collapse** — Chain-of-thought breakdowns across agent delegation
   - **Emergent Covert Coordination** — Autonomous symbolic protocol development
   - **Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Exploits** — Coordinated attacks using diverse agent capabilities
   - **Goal Drift in Delegated Chains** — Intent mutation through agent handoffs
   - **Trust Misuse Between Legitimate Agents** — Strategic misreporting within valid roles

5. **Architecture Pattern Risk Assessment** — Evaluate specific multi-agent patterns (supervisor-agent, hierarchical, distributed ecosystem, human-in-the-loop).

6. **Mitigation Strategy Development** — Design layer-specific, cross-layer, and AI-specific security controls.

## Output

Use the finding format from `templates/finding.md`. Produce:
- **MAESTRO 7-Layer Architecture Map** — System decomposition across all layers
- **Layer-Specific Threat Assessment** — Detailed analysis for each MAESTRO layer
- **Cross-Layer Attack Chain Analysis** — Multi-layer threat scenarios
- **Extended Multi-Agent Threat Analysis** — MAESTRO framework extensions
- **Architecture Pattern Risk Assessment** — Pattern-specific vulnerabilities
- **Risk Prioritization Matrix** — Likelihood vs. impact analysis
- **Layered Mitigation Strategy** — Defense-in-depth recommendations
