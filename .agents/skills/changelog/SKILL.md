  Generates a personal markdown changelog of merged or closed pull requests
  authored by the current user and Linear tickets the user closed or worked
  on, over a configurable window (default 7 days), grouped by feature area
  (e.g. Dashboards, Agent0). Inputs sourced from `gh search prs --author=@me`
  and the Linear MCP. Use for weekly recaps, status updates, performance
  reviews, or end-of-sprint summaries. Triggers on "changelog",
  "what have I done", "weekly summary", "my recent work", "recap my week",
  "/changelog".

# Changelog

Generate a markdown changelog of the current user's recent work — merged
or closed pull requests, plus Linear tickets they closed or worked on —
grouped by feature area. Render the result against the template in
[`templates/changelog.md`](./templates/changelog.md) and print it to the
chat.

## Arguments

Three orthogonal arguments. Flag order is free. `days` is positional.

### `days` (positional, optional)

Controls the window in days.

| Input            | Resolved window                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| (none)           | 7 days, ending today (UTC)                       |
| `14`             | 14 days, ending today                            |
| `30`             | 30 days, ending today                            |
| Any non-integer  | Reject with an error; do not assume a value      |

### `--scope=current|all` (default: `current`)

- `current` (DEFAULT) — restrict PRs to the GitHub repo of the **current
  working directory**, resolved via
  `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`. Linear tickets
  are **not** narrowed (Linear has no repo concept) — say so in the
  rendered output.
- `all` — query every repo the user authored PRs in. Output is grouped
  **by repo first**, then by feature bucket inside each repo (see
  [Output rules](#output-rules)).

If `--scope=current` is passed but the cwd is not a GitHub-linked git
repo, error and exit 1 — do not silently fall back to `all`. The error
must read:
`Current directory is not a GitHub-linked git repo. Re-run with --scope=all or cd into a repo.`

### `--audience=technical|general` (default: `technical`)

- `technical` (DEFAULT) — existing rendering: conventional-commit scopes
  as buckets, identifier-level summaries, full PR numbers inline.
- `general` — re-render for a non-engineering audience (see
  [Audience modes](#audience-modes)).

### Argument parsing

Parse flags in any order; the first non-flag positional integer is
`days`. Unknown flags must error. Compute the window once at start with:

```bash
DAYS=7
SCOPE=current
AUDIENCE=technical
# Slash-command skills receive the raw argument string in $ARGUMENTS,
# not positional parameters — split it on whitespace before iterating.
read -r -a ARGS <<< "$ARGUMENTS"
for arg in "${ARGS[@]}"; do
  case "$arg" in
    --scope=current|--scope=all) SCOPE="${arg#--scope=}" ;;
    --audience=technical|--audience=general) AUDIENCE="${arg#--audience=}" ;;
    --*) echo "Unknown flag: $arg" >&2; exit 1 ;;
    *) DAYS="$arg" ;;
  esac
done
[[ "$DAYS" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]*$ ]] || {
  echo "Argument must be a positive integer number of days (got \"$DAYS\")." >&2
  exit 1
}
SINCE="$(date -u -v-"${DAYS}"d +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null \
         || date -u --date="${DAYS} days ago" +%Y-%m-%d)"   # BSD then GNU
UNTIL="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)"

case "$SCOPE" in
  current)
    REPO="$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner 2>/dev/null)" || {
      echo "Current directory is not a GitHub-linked git repo. Re-run with --scope=all or cd into a repo." >&2
      exit 1
    }
    SCOPE_FILTER="repo:${REPO}"
    ;;
  all)
    SCOPE_FILTER=""
    ;;
esac
```

`gh search` treats `--merged-at` and `--closed` date ranges as **inclusive**
on both ends. Document the inclusive semantics in the rendered output so
back-to-back invocations on consecutive weeks do not silently double-count
the boundary day.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve window** — compute `SINCE` and `UNTIL` (UTC). Print them once.
2. **Fetch PRs** — see [Data sources](#data-sources); one `gh search prs`
   query, partitioned agent-side into `merged` and `closed` by `state`.
3. **Fetch Linear tickets** — closed or updated in the window where the
   current user is assignee or contributor.
4. **Classify each item** by feature area (see [Feature grouping](#feature-grouping)).
5. **Render** the template, sort features alphabetically (except a fixed
   `Other` bucket which always sorts last), sort items within a feature by
   `closedAt` descending.
6. **Print** the rendered markdown to the chat. Wrap it in a **4-backtick
   outer fence** (`` ```` ``) so the user can copy it cleanly without the
   inner triple-backtick blocks (links, headings, inline code in PR
   titles) breaking the fence.

Do not write the output to a file unless the user explicitly asks.

## Data sources

### Pull requests — GitHub

Use `gh search prs` (cross-repo, scoped to the current user as author).
The CLI is required.

`gh search prs` exposes `state`, `closedAt`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`
in its JSON output — but **not** `mergedAt`. Partition merged vs.
closed-not-merged agent-side using the `state` field (`merged` or
`closed`). Run a single query, then split:

```bash
LIMIT=100
gh search prs \
  --author=@me \
  --state=closed \
  --closed="${SINCE}..${UNTIL}" \
  ${SCOPE_FILTER:+$SCOPE_FILTER} \
  --limit "${LIMIT}" \
  --json title,number,url,state,closedAt,repository,labels,body
```

When `$SCOPE_FILTER` is set (scope=current), `gh search prs` accepts the
`repo:<owner>/<name>` qualifier as a free-form search token alongside
the typed flags.

In the agent:

- `state == "merged"` → "Shipped" section.
- `state == "closed"` → "Closed without merge" section.

**Truncation guard:** if the result set length equals `LIMIT`, prepend a
`> Warning: PR results truncated at ${LIMIT}. Narrow the window with
/changelog <smaller-days>.` line above the rendered output. Do not
silently drop work.

If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, print the install / auth hint and
continue with Linear-only data — do not fail the whole skill.

### Linear tickets — MCP

Use whichever Linear MCP server is connected in the active environment.
Tool names vary by server (`mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_issues`,
`linear__search_issues`, `mcp__linear__list_issues`, …) — resolve the
list-issues and get-issue tools at runtime from the available-tools list,
do not hard-code the namespace.

Query for issues where:

- `assignee` is the current viewer (use `me` / current user filter), and
- `updatedAt >= SINCE`, and
- state is `completed` or `canceled`, **or** the issue had activity in the
  window (comment / status change).

If no Linear MCP tool is available, print a one-line notice and proceed
with PR-only data — do not fail.

## Feature grouping

Bucket each PR and ticket into a feature area. Apply this lookup in order;
the first match wins.

| Signal                                                       | Bucket                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Conventional-commit scope in PR title (`feat(<scope>): ...`) | The `<scope>` (Title-cased)  |
| Linear project name                                          | The project name             |
| Linear team label that names a product area                  | The label (Title-cased)      |
| PR label matching `area:*`, `feature:*`, `scope:*`           | The suffix (Title-cased)     |
| Repository name (single-repo / monorepo apps)                | The repo or top-level path   |
| Top-level directory of changed files (monorepos)             | The directory (Title-cased)  |
| No signal                                                    | `Other`                      |

**Title-casing rule:** keep brand names verbatim (`Agent0`, `OTel`,
`Dash0`); only Title-case generic scopes (`dashboards` → `Dashboards`,
`auth` → `Auth`). Maintain a small allow-list of brand spellings inferred
from the data — do not invent capitalisation.

Two items in different sources (a PR and a Linear ticket) that describe
the same work should appear under the **same** bucket. Cross-reference by:

- Branch name embedded in the PR (often `<TICKET-ID>-...`).
- Explicit `Closes <TICKET-ID>` / `Fixes <TICKET-ID>` in the PR body.

When the PR `body` field is empty (private-repo body the authenticated
user cannot read), fall back to the branch-name heuristic only — do not
drop the entry.

When a PR closes a ticket, render the PR as the primary entry and append
the ticket ID inline (see template). Do not double-list.

**Known boundary:** `--author=@me` returns PRs the user **opened**.
Co-authored-by attributions are not captured. This is intentional for a
personal recap, but state it so the empty-looking week is not a bug.

## Output rules

### Scope-aware structure

- `scope=current` (default): feature buckets at H2 (existing behavior).
- `scope=all`: **repo** at H2, **feature buckets** at H3 inside each
  repo. Repos sorted alphabetically; an `Other` repo bucket (for
  unattributable items) sorts last. Feature buckets inside each repo
  follow the existing alphabetical rule, with `Other` last.

### Audience modes

**`technical` (default)** — unchanged. All existing rules in this
section apply.

**`general`** — re-render the same data for a non-engineering reader
(use case: weekly all-hands recap). Apply these substitutions:

- **Theme buckets** replace feature buckets: *Performance*,
  *Reliability & bug fixes*, *New features*, *Polish & UX*. Map by
  conventional-commit type: `perf` → Performance, `fix` → Reliability,
  `feat` → New features, `chore` / `docs` / `refactor` → Polish. Items
  without a type are placed by judgement.
- **User-visible impact** replaces identifier-level summaries. Strip
  jargon (`memoize`, `parsedExpression`, `useEventSource`,
  `transformBody`, `rAF`, `jsonHash`, `isEqual`, etc.). Lead with the
  outcome a non-engineer would notice.
- **Omit** the `Closed without merge` section.
- **Keep** a short inline link at the end of every bullet using the same
  `([#123]({{PR_URL}}))` format as technical mode. Do **not** emit a
  `## References` footer.
- The Summary paragraph is 2–3 plain-English sentences focused on
  user-visible change for the week.
- Skip the inclusive-date footnote.
- When combined with `scope=all`: repos are H2, themes are H3 inside
  each repo. Repos ordered by PR count descending (largest contribution
  first).

### General rules

- Always emit a single Markdown block — render against
  [`templates/changelog.md`](./templates/changelog.md) verbatim, wrapped
  in a 4-backtick outer fence.
- Feature buckets sort alphabetically; the `Other` bucket always sorts
  last.
- Within a bucket, sort by merged / closed date descending.
- Each line cites the PR number (`#123`), the repo if cross-repo, and the
  Linear ticket ID where applicable.
- One-line summary per item — strip emoji from titles; keep imperative
  voice; drop trailing punctuation.
- **Empty window**: render the template with `{{ONE_PARAGRAPH_SUMMARY}}`
  set to `No activity in this window.`, `{{TOTAL_PRS}}` and
  `{{TOTAL_TICKETS}}` set to `0`, and **all feature buckets omitted**. Do
  not fabricate work, and do not stretch the window.

## Template

The literal output template lives in
[`templates/changelog.md`](./templates/changelog.md). The user edits that
file to adjust shape, headings, or summary line; the skill never edits the
template itself.

## Examples

### Good — invoked with default window

```
/changelog
```

Resolves `SINCE=2026-05-04`, `UNTIL=2026-05-11`, `--scope=current`,
`--audience=technical`. Fetches the user's PRs in the **current repo
only** and renders the technical template inside a fenced block.

### Good — invoked with a custom window

```
/changelog 30
```

Defaults to `--scope=current --audience=technical`. 30-day window for
the repo of the current directory.

### Good — explicit org-wide weekly summary

```
/changelog 7 --scope=all --audience=general
```

Cross-repo, general-audience rendering. Repos are H2, themes
(*Performance* / *Reliability* / *New features* / *Polish*) are H3
inside each. Every bullet ends with a short inline `([#123](...))`
link — no separate references footer. Repos ordered by PR count
descending.

### Good — explicit single-repo technical recap

```
/changelog 14 --scope=current
```

14-day window for the current repo, technical rendering. Equivalent to
the default behavior with a wider window.

### Bad — invoked with a non-integer

```
/changelog last-month
```

Reject: `Argument must be a positive integer number of days (got "last-month").`
Do not silently coerce to 7.

### Bad — `--scope=current` outside a GitHub-linked repo

Re-run with `--scope=all` or `cd` into a repo. The skill must not
silently fall back.

## Anti-patterns

- Fabricating items because the window is empty — print the empty-state
  message instead.
- Re-Title-casing brand names (`agent0` → `Agent 0`, `dash0` → `Dash 0`).
  Keep brand spellings verbatim.
- Listing the same work twice when a PR closes a Linear ticket — merge
  into one entry.
- Writing the output to a file by default. Print to chat unless asked.
- Stretching the window to "fill" a short list. The window is the user's
  contract.
- Silently falling back from `--scope=current` to `--scope=all` when cwd
  is not a GitHub-linked git repo. Error explicitly.
- Mixing technical jargon into `--audience=general` output. The audience
  switch is load-bearing — strip identifier-level terms ruthlessly.
- Keeping the `Closed without merge` section in `--audience=general`.
  Abandoned branches are noise for a non-engineering audience.

## Definition of done

- [ ] `SINCE` and `UNTIL` resolved (UTC) and printed once.
- [ ] `gh search prs --author=@me` queried for both merged and closed sets
      (or a one-line skip notice printed if `gh` is missing).
- [ ] Linear MCP queried for the current viewer's tickets in the window
      (or a one-line skip notice printed if MCP is unavailable).
- [ ] `--scope` resolved (default `current`); when `current`, the
      `gh search prs` query carries a `repo:<owner>/<name>` filter;
      when `all`, output is grouped by repo (H2) then feature (H3).
- [ ] `--audience` resolved (default `technical`); when `general`, theme
      buckets / user-visible impact / inline-PR-links / no-Closed-section
      rules applied and the jargon strip-list enforced.
- [ ] Each item bucketed by feature using the lookup table above.
- [ ] PR / ticket pairs merged into a single entry where one closes the
      other.
- [ ] Output rendered against `templates/changelog.md` and printed inside
      a 4-backtick outer fence (so inner triple-backtick blocks don't
      escape).
- [ ] Feature buckets sorted alphabetically with `Other` last.
- [ ] Empty windows produce the empty-state message — never fabricated
      items.
