<!--
DEPRECATED — kept for backward compatibility only.

The autonomous-workflow now installs two agents (`aw-planner` +
`aw-executor`) under the `aw-` namespace, connected by `plan.md`. This
single-agent template is no longer linked by `install.sh`.

Existing installs that point at this file still work, but new installs
should use `aw-planner.agent.md` + `aw-executor.agent.md`.

See:
- `../rules/planner-executor-handoff.md` — handoff contract
- `./aw-planner.agent.md`
- `./aw-executor.agent.md`

# Autonomous Workflow Agent (deprecated single-agent template)

This template is preserved for users with existing installs that still link
to it. New installs use the planner + executor split — see
[`aw-planner.agent.md`](./aw-planner.agent.md) and
[`aw-executor.agent.md`](./aw-executor.agent.md), with the contract
described in
[`../rules/planner-executor-handoff.md`](../rules/planner-executor-handoff.md).

## First: Load the full skill

```
Skill(skill: "autonomous-workflow")
```

The skill body contains all phases (0–7), companion invocations, and rules.
Follow them. If the skill is unavailable, install it via the project README.
