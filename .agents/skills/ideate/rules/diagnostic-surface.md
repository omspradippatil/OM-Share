## Existing guards per phase

| Phase | Existing guards                                                        | Typical gaps                                                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Depth-triage table; missing-problem refusal.                             | Ambiguous asks triaged quick when the user wanted depth.                    |
| 1     | Width-varied framings; autonomous default (one step wider than literal). | Framing chosen re-states the literal ask five ways (no real width variance). |
| 2     | Persona-per-call; mandatory burst 2; gate-met/yield/4-burst stopping rule. | Personas too similar; operators assigned but ignored by generators.         |
| 3     | Anonymization; order-swap pairs; length normalization; quality-gated finalist admission (emergent count). | Composite used for selection despite the selection rules; finalist list truncated to a fixed count instead of following the admission bar. |
| 4     | Niche elitism; 3-round cap; external re-scoring.                         | Niches drawn too coarsely (everything lands in 2 buckets).                   |
| 5     | Executability probe; confidence thresholds.                              | Probe written as marketing prose instead of a first concrete step.           |
| 6     | Template with run stats + verdict question.                              | Wildcard silently dropped when it scored poorly.                             |
| 7     | Mechanics-only content policy; verdict-gated calibration lessons.         | Calibration lesson written without an actual user verdict.                   |

## Failure taxonomy

| ID      | Class                  | Symptom                                                                    | Primary phase | Primary gate / companion                                           |
| ------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| F1      | Depth mis-triage       | Deep pipeline on a trivial ask, or quick on an open-ended one.               | 0             | Depth-triage table.                                                 |
| F2      | Homogeneous pool       | Pool passes the count gate but ideas share 1–2 mechanisms.                   | 2             | Persona/operator rotation; dedup-by-mechanism.                      |
| F3      | Judge miscalibration   | User verdict contradicts the ranking (picked a low-ranked idea, rejected finalists). | 3        | Axis independence; selection rules; panel vote.                     |
| F4      | Novelty loss           | All finalists are safe/incremental; wildcard missing or token.               | 3             | Novelty-protection rule.                                            |
| F5      | Evolution degradation  | Later rounds produced duplicates or lower external scores that were kept.    | 4             | Stopping criteria; external re-scoring.                             |
| F6      | Unvalidated finalists  | Recommendation shipped without probes or below the confidence threshold.     | 5             | Executability probe; confidence gate.                               |
| F-novel | Novel mode             | Does not match any existing row.                                             | —             | Diagnosis proposes a new row inline (added on user approval only).  |

Taxonomy is append-only.
Every new row must come from a real, confidence-gated, user-approved diagnosis.

## Hard invariants

- Generation and evaluation never co-occur in one pass.
- Divergence runs lessons-blind; lessons never carry idea content or user idea-taste.
- The judge is never the generator; finalists in deep mode require the 3-judge panel.
- At least one high-novelty wildcard survives to the report.
- The 3-round evolution cap (1 in quick mode) cannot be raised.
- The `confidence(analysis)` gate on finalists cannot be skipped or its thresholds lowered.

## Artifacts

## Lessons scope

- Bucket: `ideate-lessons` — LoreKit tag `loop::ideate-lessons`, key namespace `ideate-lessons::<slug>`
- Scopes: `global` (always, universal) + `repo::{owner}/{repo}` (project-bound, cwd repo)
- Read for evidence with the narrow-to-broad fan-out:

  ```text
  memory.list { scope: "repo::{owner}/{repo}", tags: ["loop::ideate-lessons"], limit: 50 }
  memory.list { scope: "global",               tags: ["loop::ideate-lessons"], limit: 50 }
  ```

## Validators

- `node scripts/eval/l1.mjs` (repo-wide link/anchor integrity — covers this skill's cross-links).
- `bash scripts/sync-symlinks.sh --dry-run` (wiring intact).
