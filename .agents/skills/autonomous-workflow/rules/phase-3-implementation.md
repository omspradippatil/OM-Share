## Receiving Planner Handoff

This is the executor's entry phase. Before starting Step 1 of implementation:

1. Verify you're inside the worktree (`pwd && git branch --show-current`).
2. Read `plan.md` end-to-end:
   ```bash
   cat .agent/$(git branch --show-current)/plan.md
   ```
3. Verify the Acceptance Criteria section is non-empty (these are the
   contract you'll gate Phase 4 testing against).
4. **Bail if missing:** if `plan.md` doesn't exist, is malformed, or has no
   Acceptance Criteria, STOP and tell the user "no plan to execute — run
   aw-planner first."
5. Log the takeover:
   ```markdown
   - [TIMESTAMP] Phase 3: executor took over (plan confidence Y%)
   ```

See [`planner-executor-handoff.md`](./planner-executor-handoff.md) for the
full handoff contract.

## Lessons Read

**Anchor:** `lessons-read`

Load `aw-lessons` for the area being implemented — **only when `plan.md` has no
`## Lessons applied` section** (i.e. the planner did not already apply them at
Phase 1). This covers the no-planner paths: Lite Mode, the `fix-bug` fast-lane,
and any direct executor dispatch. If `plan.md` already lists applied lessons,
skip — they are already in context.

```
memory.list { scope: "repo::{owner}/{repo}", tags: ["loop::aw-lessons"], limit: 50 }   # no-op if memory.* not connected
memory.list { scope: "global",               tags: ["loop::aw-lessons"], limit: 50 }
```

Union both results. Match each lesson's `trigger-context` against the files /
area you are about to touch; treat matches as constraints (same advisory rule
as the planner's read). `repo::` lessons win on conflict with `global`.
Full contract: [`self-improvement-loop.md`](./self-improvement-loop.md#fast-tier--read-lessons).

Disable by removing this invocation (see
[`companion-skills.md`](./companion-skills.md#registry)).

## Overview

Incremental implementation with continuous verification. Work in the isolated
worktree created in Phase 2. Follow existing patterns, commit at logical
milestones, and invoke companions per task signal.

Companions invoked from this phase **skip silently if not installed** — see
[`companion-skills.md`](./companion-skills.md) for the full registry.

## Prerequisite

Before starting, verify:

| Check                                   | Command                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Worktree exists                         | `gw list` (with `gw`) or `git worktree list` (native)  |
| Currently in the worktree directory     | `pwd`                                                  |
| Dependencies installed                  | per project (`pnpm i`, `go mod tidy`)                  |
| Environment validated                   | type-check or compile passes                           |
| `plan.md` populated (Full Mode)         | `cat .agent/{branch}/plan.md`                          |

If the worktree was not created, **STOP and return to Phase 2.**

## Core Principles

| Principle                              | What it means                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Follow existing patterns               | Consistency with codebase                        |
| Implement incrementally                | Small, focused changes — one concern per edit    |
| Verify after every edit                | Fast type-check / compile before moving on       |
| Commit at logical milestones           | Atomic commits with conventional format          |
| Invoke companions per signal           | TDD / UX / code-quality at the right moments     |
| Controlled fan-out when file-disjoint  | Cap 3 concurrent sub-agents; each inherits Sub-Agent Resource Discipline (see [`rules/parallel-coordination.md#sub-agent-resource-discipline`](./parallel-coordination.md#sub-agent-resource-discipline)) |

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Read `plan.md` Implementation Order

Open `.agent/{branch}/plan.md` and follow the **Implementation Order** section
verbatim. Typical order:

1. Types / interfaces (if TypeScript)
2. Core logic / pure functions
3. UI components (if applicable)
4. Integration / glue code
5. Configuration updates

If `plan.md` is missing (Lite Mode), use the order above as the default.

### Step 2: One Change at a Time

**Before editing**

- Read the existing file completely.
- Identify insertion points.
- Note the existing patterns and naming.

**During editing**

- Make a single focused change.
- Match existing code style and formatting.

**After editing — verify (fast check)**

Run the project's fastest type-check / compile loop. Examples:

```bash
# TypeScript — scoped (preferred inside sub-agents)
npx tsc --noEmit -p <project-tsconfig>   # if tsconfig.json has "references"
npx eslint <changed-files>               # lint only the files you touched
# If no project references exist, SKIP tsc in sub-agents — leave it to Phase 4 Step 6
# WARNING: npx tsc --noEmit (no path) is FORBIDDEN inside sub-agents —
#          it loads the whole program regardless of file arguments.

go vet ./...                  # Go vet (scoped by module — acceptable)
cargo check                   # Rust compile check (scoped by crate — acceptable)
ruff check <file>             # Python lint
```

> **Sub-Agent Resource Discipline applies here.** Inside a sub-agent, run
> only scoped / path-narrowed commands. Whole-project `npm run lint`,
> `npx tsc --noEmit` (without project refs), `npm test` (without
> `--testPathPattern`), and `npm run build` are reserved for the orchestrator.
> See [`rules/parallel-coordination.md#sub-agent-resource-discipline`](./parallel-coordination.md#sub-agent-resource-discipline).

| Outcome           | Action                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pass              | Move to next file                                                      |
| Fail              | Fix immediately. **Max 3 attempts on the same failure.**               |
| Still failing     | Stop iterating; reassess the approach (re-read the surrounding code, revisit `plan.md`, ask if root assumption is wrong) |

The 3-attempt cap mirrors the [Phase 4 stuck-loop protocol](./phase-4-testing.md#stuck-loop-detection)
and exists for the same reason: more than three local attempts almost always
means the mental model is wrong.

### Step 3: Companion Triggers

Invoke companions at the moments described below. Detailed trigger conditions,
invocation, and disable instructions live in:

- [TDD Trigger](#tdd-trigger) — pure logic / business rules
- [UX Trigger](#ux-trigger) — UI files touched
- [Observability Trigger](#observability-trigger) — API/handler or user-facing files touched
- [Code Quality Trigger](#code-quality-trigger) — once at end of phase

**All companions skip silently if not installed** — log the result and continue.

### Step 4: Commit at Milestones

Every 2-3 files (or after a logically complete unit), commit:

```bash
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"
```

**Conventional commit format:**

| Type     | Example                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`   | `feat(ui): add dark mode toggle button`              |
| `feat`   | `feat(theme): implement theme context provider`      |
| `test`   | `test(theme): add theme toggle unit tests`           |
| `refactor` | `refactor(api): extract pagination helper`         |
| `fix`    | `fix(parser): handle empty input`                    |

**Rules:**

- One logical change per commit.
- Descriptive messages — explain *why* in the body when non-obvious.

### Step 5: Keep `plan.md` honest — Progress Log + drift write-back (Full Mode)

`plan.md` is only worth keeping if it is **consumed and kept current** — a
write-once, never-re-read plan is dead weight. Two obligations:

**(a) Progress Log.** At each milestone (not after every file), append to the
Progress Log in `.agent/{branch}/plan.md`:

```markdown
- [2026-04-29T15:42:10Z] Phase 3: Implemented ThemeContext + ThemeToggle
- [2026-04-29T15:48:33Z] Phase 3: Updated Tailwind config for dark mode classes
- [2026-04-29T15:51:05Z] Phase 3: ux() — invoked (2 contrast suggestions integrated)
- [2026-04-29T15:55:12Z] Phase 3: code-quality(code) — not available, continuing
```

**(b) Drift write-back.** When implementation reveals that a *decision* or
*requirement* in the plan no longer matches reality — the classic stale-plan
failure mode, from evidence drift (a decision proved wrong) or conversation
drift (the user changed direction mid-run) — **update the affected `plan.md`
section**, not only the Progress Log. If an Acceptance Criterion changes,
re-derive its `checks.yaml` entry too (IDs stay in sync). A silently stale plan
misleads the next reader (a resumed session, `confidence`, the walkthrough); a
one-line log entry that contradicts the section body above it is worse than no
log. Keep the edit minimal — this is not a re-plan (that is the Phase 4
stuck-loop's job), just keeping the handoff document truthful.

A user-requested change that arrives mid-run is conversation drift, **not scope
creep** — fold it into the plan and implement it; never bounce it back as
out-of-scope (see
[`safety-guardrails.md#user-requested-changes-are-never-scope-creep`](./safety-guardrails.md#user-requested-changes-are-never-scope-creep)).
If the change is large enough to need re-planning (architectural / cross-cutting),
hand back to the planner rather than absorbing it as a minimal drift edit.

Use full ISO 8601 timestamps with hours, minutes, seconds.

### Step 6: Periodic Broader Validation

After every 2-3 files, run a wider check beyond the fast type-check:

```bash
# Tests related to changed code
npm test -- --testPathPattern="<area>"

# Full build
npm run build
```

**Self-assessment questions:**

- Is the implementation tracking with `plan.md`?
- Any deviations? Are they justified, and is `plan.md` updated?
- Are checks getting cleaner each iteration, or repeatedly catching the same class of issue?

If the same class of issue keeps appearing, that's a Phase-4-style stuck loop
forming early. Stop, reassess, and consider re-reading `plan.md` before
continuing. See [Phase 4 stuck-loop protocol](./phase-4-testing.md#stuck-loop-detection)
for the recovery pattern.

### Step 7: Pre-Testing Commit

After all implementation is complete and `code-quality(code)` has been invoked:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): implement <feature-name>

- Detail 1
- Detail 2"
```

## TDD Trigger

This section is the anchor referenced from [`companion-skills.md`](./companion-skills.md#registry).

**When:** task involves pure logic, business rules, or the user explicitly
requested "test-driven" / "TDD".

```bash
Skill("tdd")
```

| Behavior                       | Detail                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owns the inner loop            | TDD drives RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle; you do not run code-quality per file while TDD is active |
| Replaces verify-after-editing  | TDD's GREEN step is the verification                                |
| If skill missing               | Log `tdd() — not available, continuing` and fall back to verify-after-editing in Step 2 |
| Progress Log entry             | `[TIMESTAMP] Phase 3: tdd() — invoked` (or `not available, continuing`) |

Disable: remove the `Skill("tdd")` invocation from this section. Registry:
[`companion-skills.md`](./companion-skills.md#registry).

---

## UX Trigger

This section is the anchor referenced from [`companion-skills.md`](./companion-skills.md#registry).

**When:** files written or edited in this phase include any of:

| Pattern                              | Examples                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`                     | React components                                  |
| `*.vue`                              | Vue single-file components                        |
| `*.svelte`                           | Svelte components                                 |
| React Native screens                 | `screens/**/*.tsx`, Expo Router `app/**/*.tsx`    |

```bash
Skill("ux")
```

| Behavior                       | Detail                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When to invoke                 | After the UI files are written, before Phase 4 testing              |
| Purpose                        | Catch accessibility / design issues while changes are fresh         |
| If skill missing               | Log `ux() — not available, continuing`; do a manual a11y scan if confident |
| Progress Log entry             | `[TIMESTAMP] Phase 3: ux() — invoked` (or `not available, continuing`) |

**Locator stability note.** Accessible names also serve E2E test stability.
When implementing UI, prefer semantic HTML and accessible names (`getByRole`,
`getByLabel`) so the locator ladder works without `data-testid`. Reach for
`data-testid` only when the source genuinely needs it (icon-only controls,
canvas-rendered elements, ambiguous repeated rows). When you do, commit the
`data-testid` in the same diff as the consuming code, never as a brittle CSS
selector workaround in a test. Full criteria:
[`code-quality/rules/testability.md#ui-testability--accessible-names-are-locators`](../../../quality/code-quality/rules/testability.md#ui-testability--accessible-names-are-locators)
and [`e2e-testing/rules/locator-strategy.md`](../../../testing/e2e-testing/rules/locator-strategy.md).

Disable: remove the `Skill("ux")` invocation from this section. Registry:
[`companion-skills.md`](./companion-skills.md#registry).

---

## Observability Trigger

This section is the anchor referenced from [`companion-skills.md`](./companion-skills.md#registry).

**When:** files written or edited in this phase match any pattern in
`measurable`'s own
[`rules/scope-detection.md`](../../../quality/measurable/rules/scope-detection.md#step-2-infer-from-the-diff-when-no-profile-exists)
Step 2 table (`web`/`mobile`/`api`/`worker` classifications) — that table is
the single source of truth for these patterns; this section does not
restate it, so it cannot drift out of sync.

```bash
Skill("measurable", "implement")
```

| Behavior                       | Detail                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When to invoke                 | After the relevant files are written, before Phase 4 testing        |
| Purpose                        | Ensure the change ships with traces/metrics/logs (API) or a RUM event (user-facing), and that every new error/warning path is visible instead of silent |
| Delegation                     | Frontend event design delegates further to `rum-tracking`; backend spans/metrics delegate to `otel-instrumentation`/`otel-semantic-conventions` when installed, else the skill's own fallback rules |
| If skill missing               | Log `measurable() — not available, continuing`          |
| Progress Log entry             | `[TIMESTAMP] Phase 3: measurable(implement) — invoked` (or `not available, continuing`) |

This is the authoring half of the pair with the [Observability Gate](./phase-4-testing.md#observability-gate)
in Phase 4, which verifies the coverage this step adds before the loop can
call the change done.

Disable: remove the `Skill("measurable", "implement")` invocation
from this section. Registry: [`companion-skills.md`](./companion-skills.md#registry).

---

## Code Quality Trigger

This section is the anchor referenced from [`companion-skills.md`](./companion-skills.md#registry).

**When:** **once** at the end of Phase 3, after all files are written and
**before** Phase 4 testing begins. **Not per-file** — TDD owns the per-file
inner loop when active.

```bash
Skill("code-quality", "code")
```

| Behavior                       | Detail                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequency                      | Exactly once per phase                                              |
| Purpose                        | Catch cognitive complexity, naming, structural smells, and **comment hygiene** (apply **R35** to trim any verbose multi-paragraph block) that emerged during implementation. Walks the full `code-quality` review checklist, not just one pass. |
| If skill missing               | Log `code-quality(code) — not available, continuing`                |
| Progress Log entry             | `[TIMESTAMP] Phase 3: code-quality(code) — invoked` (or `not available, continuing`) |

Disable: remove the `Skill("code-quality", "code")` invocation from this section.
Registry: [`companion-skills.md`](./companion-skills.md#registry).
