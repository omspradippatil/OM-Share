## Mode Detection

Check the arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

| Argument         | Default | Validates                                                          | When to use                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plan`           |         | Implementation plan completeness                                   | After Phase 1 planning, before autonomous execution                          |
| `code`           | **yes** | Code implementation correctness                                    | After writing code, before PR                                                |
| `analysis`       |         | Analysis accuracy (root cause, refactor rationale, or skill gap)   | During investigation, before proposing a fix, refactor, or skill-source diff |
| `bug-analysis`   |         | **Deprecated alias for `analysis`** — behaves identically          | Backwards-compatible; emit a one-line deprecation note in the report header  |

If no argument is provided, default to `code`.

**Alias handling.** `bug-analysis` is accepted as a deprecated alias and resolves to `analysis` with identical dimensions, weights, thresholds, and Fix Mode behaviour. When invoked with the alias, prepend a single line to the report header: `> Note: \`bug-analysis\` is a deprecated alias for \`analysis\`. Update the caller when convenient.` The alias keeps in-flight workflows and existing transcripts working through the transition; remove it after callers have migrated.

If arguments contain **"fix"** (e.g., `code fix`, `plan fix`, `analysis fix`), run in **Fix Mode** — after the review, automatically apply fixes for any concerns found.

## Assessment Dimensions

### For `plan` mode

**Plan mode is multi-signal: LLM dimensional scoring + deterministic rule checks.** Both must pass for the gate to clear.

#### Step 1 — LLM dimensional scoring

| Dimension        | Weight | What to evaluate                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Completeness** | 40%    | Are ALL Phase 0 requirements captured? Are the Core sections populated (and the Extended sections present where the task needs them)? Could a new session execute from this plan alone? Do NOT penalize an Extended section that is legitimately omitted because its `Include when` trigger does not apply (e.g. no Existing Code Survey on a modification-only plan). DO score down an Existing Code Survey whose "Searched for" column is vague ("looked around") or whose `BUILD NEW` verdicts show no searches — rule #10 checks presence, this dimension checks search quality. |
| **Feasibility**  | 30%    | Is the technical approach sound? Are patterns consistent with the codebase? Are risks identified where applicable?                |
| **No ambiguity** | 30%    | Are implementation steps specific enough to execute without interpretation? Are edge cases addressed where applicable?            |

#### Step 2 — Deterministic rule checks (run via Bash)

Every check below MUST pass for plan mode. A single failed rule caps the gate at **89% regardless of LLM score** — the agent must surface the failed rule and either fix the plan or escalate to the user. Rules #10 and #11 are **conditionally applicable** (their trigger condition is part of the rule); when the condition does not hold they pass vacuously with a logged note — they never silently skip.

| # | Rule check                                                | Verification                                                                                       |
| - | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | `plan.md` exists at the expected path                     | `test -f .agent/$(git branch --show-current)/plan.md`                                              |
| 2 | All Core sections present                                 | `grep -E '^## (TL;DR\|Requirements\|Decisions\|Acceptance Criteria\|Implementation Order\|File Changes\|Verification\|Progress Log)' plan.md \| wc -l` ≥ 8 — these are the always-on Core tier. Extended sections (Background, Technical Approach, Patterns, Edge Cases, API, Tests, Dependencies, Risks) are include-when-needed and are NOT counted here. |
| 3 | Acceptance Criteria section is non-empty                  | `awk '/^## Acceptance Criteria/{f=1;next} /^###? /{f=0} f' plan.md \| grep -c '^- \|^[0-9]'` ≥ 1                       |
| 4 | Every file in `## File Changes` resolves OR is `create`   | For each modify/delete row, `git ls-files <path>` returns the path. Create rows skip this check.   |
| 5 | Every requirement is tagged `[user-stated]` or `[inferred]`| `awk '/^## Requirements/{f=1;next} /^###? /{f=0} !f{next} /^[-0-9]/{n++} /\[user-stated\]/{t++} /\[inferred\]/{t++} END{exit n!=t}' plan.md` exits 0 — the tag count must equal the requirement count (the range stops at `### Out of Scope`, so excluded items are not counted). Single awk command with no shell pipes, so the table row executes verbatim. |
| 6 | Every decision row has a Rationale column populated       | `awk -F'[\|]' '/^## Decisions/{f=1;next} /^###? /{f=0} !f{next} !/^[\|]/{next} {r++} r<3{next} NF<5{bad=1} $4 ~ /^[ \t]*$/{bad=1} END{exit bad}' plan.md` exits 0 — no missing or empty cells in the Rationale (third) column of the Decisions table. The field separator and row match use the bracket class `[\|]`, so the command needs no shell pipes and executes verbatim. |
| 7 | All timestamps are ISO 8601 with time component           | `awk '/^## Progress Log/{f=1;next} /^###? /{f=0} !f{next} /^- /{n++} /^- \[20[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]T[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]Z\]/{t++} END{exit n!=t}' plan.md` exits 0 — every Progress Log entry starts with a `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ]` timestamp. Single awk command with no shell pipes, so the table row executes verbatim. |
| 8 | Verification commands are non-template                    | "After editing" and "Before PR" lines do not contain `{` or `}` placeholder braces                 |
| 9 | Every `[user-stated]` requirement is covered by an Acceptance Criterion | `awk '/^## Requirements/ {rs=1; as=0; next} /^## Acceptance Criteria/ {as=1; rs=0; next} /^###? / {rs=0; as=0} rs && /^[-0-9]/ {n++; if (index($0,"[user-stated]")) us[n]=1} as {s=$0; while (match(s, /covers:[^)]*/)) {seg=substr(s,RSTART,RLENGTH); s=substr(s,RSTART+RLENGTH); while (match(seg,/R[0-9]+/)) {cov[substr(seg,RSTART+1,RLENGTH-1)]=1; seg=substr(seg,RSTART+RLENGTH)}}} END {for (i in us) if (!(i in cov)) exit 1; exit 0}' plan.md` exits 0 — requirements are numbered by list position (first item = R1; Out of Scope items excluded by the `###` reset); every position tagged `[user-stated]` must appear in a `(covers: R…)` annotation in the Acceptance Criteria. This is the requirement→criterion traceability gate: a plan cannot silently drop a user-stated requirement. Single awk command with no shell pipes, so the table row executes verbatim. |
| 10 | Every planned `create` has an Existing Code Survey verdict | `awk -F'[\|]' '/^## File Changes/ {fc=1; es=0; next} /^## Existing Code Survey/ {es=1; fc=0; next} /^###? / {fc=0; es=0} fc && /^[\|]/ && $2 ~ /create/ {creates++} es && /^[\|]/ {if (index($0,"EXTEND") + index($0,"WRAP") + index($0,"BUILD NEW") > 0) rows++} END {if (creates == 0) exit 0; exit (rows < 1)}' plan.md` exits 0 — when the File Changes table has ≥ 1 `create` row, the `## Existing Code Survey` section must exist with ≥ 1 verdict row (`EXTEND` / `WRAP` / `BUILD NEW`). Modification-only plans pass vacuously (the section is legitimately omitted). This is the anti-reinvention gate: no new unit without a recorded reuse search. The field separator uses the bracket class `[\|]` and the verdict match uses pipe-free `index()` sums, so the command needs no shell pipes and executes verbatim. |
| 11 | `checks.yaml` exists and its IDs are in sync with the plan | Applies only when the Acceptance Criteria carry `AC-{n}` IDs (un-IDed plans — e.g. `/fix-bug` fast-lane — skip with a logged note). Verify: `test -f .agent/$(git branch --show-current)/checks.yaml`, then for each `AC-{n}` in the plan's Acceptance Criteria section, `grep -c "^- id: AC-{n}$" checks.yaml` returns ≥ 1, and every `id:` in checks.yaml resolves to an AC in the plan. Any orphan in either direction fails. |

Run each check, list pass/fail in the output table. **A failing rule is a blocker the gate must surface even if the LLM dimensional score is high.**

#### Step 3 — Combined gate

```
overall_score = min(weighted_LLM_score, max_allowed_by_rule_checks)
where max_allowed_by_rule_checks = 100% if all rules pass, else 89%
```

The intent: a plan that scores 95% on LLM judgment but fails rule check #4 (references a file path that doesn't exist) is capped at 89% — and the gate fails. This catches the failure mode where the model is confident but the plan is grounded in hallucinated paths.

### For `code` mode

| Dimension          | Weight | What to evaluate                                              |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Correctness**    | 40%    | Does the logic actually address the problem as described?     |
| **Completeness**   | 30%    | Are all cases, edge cases, and requirements covered?          |
| **No regressions** | 30%    | Could this break existing behavior or introduce side effects? |

### For `analysis` mode

Use this mode whenever the artifact being graded is **an analysis** — a root-cause write-up, a refactor rationale, a `/create-skill diagnose` proposal, a holistic re-analysis after a stuck loop, or any other reasoning artifact that precedes a proposed change.

| Dimension                | Weight | What to evaluate                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Evidence strength**    | 40%    | Is the analysis backed by concrete evidence (logs, traces, code paths, file:line references, reproduced behaviour)?         |
| **Root cause certainty** | 30%    | Is this the underlying cause or just a symptom? How deep did the investigation go? For refactor / diagnose analyses, read "root cause" as "the actual structural reason," not literal bug aetiology. |
| **Outcome confidence**   | 30%    | Will the proposed action (fix, refactor, skill-source diff) resolve the situation without introducing new problems?         |

## Confidence: X%

### LLM dimensional scoring

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| <dim 1>   | X%    | ...   |
| <dim 2>   | X%    | ...   |
| <dim 3>   | X%    | ...   |

### Deterministic rule checks (plan mode only — omit for code/analysis)

| # | Rule                | Status      | Evidence                  |
|---|---------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | <rule description>  | ✓ pass / ✗ fail | <command output snippet> |
| ... |                   |             |                           |

### Combined gate

- Weighted LLM score: X%
- Rule checks: <N pass> / <total> (cap: 100% if all pass, else 89%)
- **Final: X%**
```

Calculate the weighted LLM score as a weighted average using the dimension weights above. For `plan` mode, the **Final** is `min(weighted_LLM_score, rule_check_cap)`. For `code` and `analysis` modes (including invocations via the deprecated `bug-analysis` alias), omit the rule-check section and `Final = weighted_LLM_score`.

**Be honest and critical — do not inflate scores. A low score with clear reasoning is more valuable than a false 95%. A failed rule check is non-negotiable — surface it even if the LLM score is high.**

## Score Thresholds

| Score         | Action                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **90-100%**   | Proceed — work is ready                                                                     |
| **70-89%**    | List specific concerns and what would raise confidence. If in Fix Mode, apply fixes.        |
| **Below 70%** | Recommend concrete next steps to validate or fix. Do NOT proceed with autonomous execution. |

---

## Iteration Protocol (plan mode)

When used as a quality gate before autonomous execution:

> If confidence is below 90%, do up to **2 iterations** of additional research, analysis, and evidence collection to raise the score.
> After each iteration, re-run the confidence assessment.
> If still below 90% after 2 iterations, present findings to the user and ask whether to proceed or refine further.

---

## Auto-Fix (Fix Mode Only)

**Skip this section entirely if not in Fix Mode.**

When running in Fix Mode (`plan fix`, `code fix`, `analysis fix` — or the deprecated `bug-analysis fix` alias), automatically address every concern that lowered your score:

### Simple Fixes (apply immediately)

Fix these without asking — they are low-risk and mechanical:

- Missing edge case handling with obvious implementation
- Missing null/undefined checks
- Off-by-one errors or incorrect boundary conditions
- Typos in strings, comments, or variable names
- Missing return types or type annotations where the type is clear
- Small logic errors with an unambiguous correction
- (plan mode) Missing sections, incomplete requirements, vague implementation steps

After applying each fix, briefly note what was changed (one line per fix).

### Complex Fixes (plan, then apply)

For issues requiring more thought:

- Missing test coverage for uncovered paths
- Incomplete implementations (missing cases, unhandled states)
- Architectural concerns or incorrect abstractions
- (plan mode) Fundamental approach issues, missing technical design

For each, output:

```
### [Issue title]
**Why:** [1-sentence explanation]
**Fix plan:**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
**Files involved:** [list]
```

Then execute the plan.

### Post-Fix Re-Assessment

After all fixes are applied:

1. Re-run the confidence assessment with updated scores
2. List what was fixed and how each fix improved the score
3. If confidence is still below 90%, list remaining concerns that could not be auto-fixed
