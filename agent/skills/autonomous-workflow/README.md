# `@aw` — Autonomous Workflow

> Execute complete feature development cycles autonomously using isolated worktrees, layered companion skills, and a CI gate.

> **📦 VS Code extension available.** Install [**Agent Tasks**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mthines.agent-tasks) from the Marketplace to visualize `plan.md`, `task.md`, and `walkthrough.md` artifacts directly in your VS Code sidebar — see in-progress phases, completed task checkboxes, decisions, and blockers at a glance. Defaults to scanning `.agent/` (with `.gw/` as fallback), configurable via `agentTasks.directories`. Source lives in [`packages/vscode-agent-tasks/`](../../../packages/vscode-agent-tasks/).

## In plain English

![How aw works: you say one thing, it sizes the job (Micro / Lite / Full), then runs an isolated pipeline — Understand, Plan, Build, Test, Document, Open PR, Green CI, Self-Review — to a ready-to-merge pull request, learning from every run.](../../../assets/aw-overview.png)

**You write one sentence. `aw` delivers a finished, tested, reviewed pull request — on its own.**

That's the whole thing. You describe the change you want, and `aw` does everything a careful engineer would do, in order, without you babysitting it:

1. **Sizes the job.** Typo? Small tweak? Real feature? It picks how much process to run, so small things stay fast.
2. **Works in isolation.** Spins up its own Git worktree, so your main branch is never touched.
3. **Plans → builds → tests → documents.** Writes the code, runs the tests, fixes what fails, updates the docs.
4. **Opens the PR.** Writes a real description and pushes a draft for you to approve.
5. **Gets CI green.** Watches the pipeline and fixes what breaks.
6. **Reviews its own work.** Runs an adversarial self-review and applies the easy fixes before you ever look.
7. **Learns.** Records lessons each run, so the next run is a little smarter.

### It looks complex. Using it is one sentence.

The machinery below — three agents, eight phases, a dozen companion skills, confidence gates — is the part that *does the work for you*. None of it is setup you have to do.

| What you see in the docs | What you actually do |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| 3 agents, 8 phases, 12 companions, confidence gates | Type one sentence (or `@aw`). |
| "Do I need to configure all this?" | No — it auto-picks how much process to run. |
| "Will it run off and break things?" | No — isolated worktree, a gate at every step, and a draft PR you approve. |

**Try it:**

```text
Implement a dark-mode toggle independently
Add user authentication end-to-end
Refactor the API client to use retry logic — handle it in isolation
```

The complexity is the machine's job, not yours. You write the sentence; it runs the machine. The rest of this README is the reference manual for when you want to look under the hood.

## What This Skill Does

This skill enables AI agents to autonomously execute complete feature
development workflows from requirements to merged PR. It provides a phase-based
procedure (0–7) where each phase has a gate and optionally invokes companion
skills based on task signals. **Companions skip silently if not installed** —
the workflow never blocks on a missing companion.

| Phase | Name                       | Gate                                             |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | Validation                 | User confirmed understanding, mode selected; requirements restated + diffed; no unresolved `blocking` missing-information item |
| 1     | Planning                   | `confidence(plan)` >= 90% (or user-approved) — incl. requirement→criterion traceability and an Existing Code Survey per planned `create`; `specs.md` drafted for UI tasks |
| 2     | Worktree Setup             | Worktree created, `plan.md` + `checks.yaml` (+ `specs.md`) written |
| 3     | Implementation             | Code complete, fast checks pass                  |
| 4 (UI)| Spec Verification          | `aw-tester` verdict `green`/`inconclusive` — runs before lint/type/test |
| 4     | Testing                    | All tests pass AND every `checks.yaml` check passes OR user-approved stop |
| 5     | Documentation              | Docs reflect changes (incl. `CLAUDE.md`)         |
| 6     | PR Creation                | Walkthrough shown, draft PR opened               |
| 7     | CI Gate + Optional Cleanup | CI green OR user-approved stop; optional spec rehearsal against preview |

## Installation

### Step 1: Install prerequisites

| Tool | Status                       | Why                                                                 |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gh` | **Required**                 | PR creation (Phase 6) and CI watching (Phase 7)                     |
| `gw` | **Recommended** *(optional)* | Worktree management with auto-copy of secrets, pre/post-checkout hooks, smart cleanup, and shell-integrated `gw cd`. The workflow falls back to native `git worktree` if `gw` is absent. |

```bash
# Required
brew install gh && gh auth login

# Recommended — gw makes worktree-heavy workflows nicer, but is NOT required
brew install mthines/gw-tools/gw
```

`gw` is **not a hard requirement** — if it's not on `PATH`, Phase 2 detects
that at Step 0 and falls through to native `git worktree` commands using the
same sibling-directory layout (`../<repo>-<branch-slug>/`). You'll be warned
once about the features you're missing (auto-copy of secrets, pre/post-checkout
hooks, smart cleanup, shell-integrated `gw cd`), then the workflow continues
normally. See [`rules/prerequisites.md#fallback-to-native-git-worktree`](./rules/prerequisites.md#fallback-to-native-git-worktree)
for the full feature comparison.

### Step 2: Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mthines/agent-skills.git
cd agent-skills
bash scripts/sync-symlinks.sh --aw
```

`--aw` symlinks the autonomous-workflow skill and its 12 companion skills,
plus the `aw` / `aw-planner` / `aw-executor` agents, into your `~/.claude/`
directory. Edits to the cloned repo are picked up live on the next agent
turn — `git pull` is the whole upgrade story.

To install **every** skill and agent in this repo (not just the AW bundle),
drop the `--aw` flag. To preview without applying, add `--dry-run` (or `-n`).

> **Prefer a no-clone install?** `npx skills add` still works — see the root
> [README](../../../README.md#install) for the npx path and other options.

Then say *"implement X independently"* (or invoke `@aw`) — the routing rule
dispatches the **`aw` dispatcher**, which detects the tier and routes: Micro/Lite
run single-pass; Full hands off to the planner→executor split.

#### What gets installed

Four agents linked into your `.claude/agents/` directory under the
**`aw-` namespace** (short for "autonomous-workflow") so they group together
and are unmistakable when listed alongside unrelated agents:

| Agent | Role | Terminal artifact | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aw` | **Opt-in dispatcher.** Reads lessons, detects tier (Micro/Lite/Full), routes, owns the self-improvement loop for every tier. | — (delegates) | Task routed + exit lesson written |
| `aw-planner` | Full tier, phases 0–2 (validation, planning, worktree + plan.md + checks.yaml + specs.md) | `.agent/{branch}/plan.md` + `checks.yaml` + `specs.md` (UI tasks) | `confidence(plan) ≥ 90%` (or user-approved override) |
| `aw-executor` | Full tier, phases 3–7 (implement, test, docs, PR, CI) | `.agent/{branch}/walkthrough.md` + draft PR | Walkthrough shown inline, Phase 7 CI gate run |
| `aw-tester` | Phase 4 spec-driven UI verification — dispatched by executor before lint/type/test | Verdict block (~200 tokens) | `green` or `inconclusive` |

`aw` is **adaptive and opt-in**: it only pays the planner→executor handoff cost
on Full tasks (where context isolation + a resumable `plan.md` earn it), and runs
Micro/Lite single-pass. It is invoked deliberately, not as a wrapper on every prompt.

**One-time UI setup:** run `/aw-setup` once per project before the first autonomous
UI task. This scaffolds `.claude/aw-targets/local.yml` (the aw-target `aw-tester` reads)
and validates it with a smoke spec. The planner halts and prompts if no aw-target exists.
See [`aw-setup/SKILL.md`](./aw-setup/SKILL.md).

> **Upgrading from a pre-`aw-` install?** The installer detects legacy
> `autonomous-planner.md` / `autonomous-executor.md` symlinks pointing at
> these templates and removes them before linking the new `aw-` names —
> no manual cleanup needed. Hand-authored files at those paths are left
> untouched.

See [`rules/planner-executor-handoff.md`](./rules/planner-executor-handoff.md) for the full handoff contract and [`references/anthropic-architecture-research.md`](./references/anthropic-architecture-research.md) for the design rationale (with verbatim Anthropic citations).

## Companion Skills

Companions are invoked at specific phases based on task signals. The full
trigger registry is in
[`rules/companion-skills.md`](./rules/companion-skills.md).

| Phase | Companion              | Required? | What it does                                  |
| ----- | ---------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | `interview`            | Optional  | Default-on scope alignment in Full Mode (adaptive — silent on a crisp request; `--no-interview` skips, `--interview` forces). Restate-and-diff + missing-information gate; writes `brief.md` |
| 1     | `lorekit-memory`       | Optional  | Reads `loop::aw-lessons` — applies prior workflow lessons as plan constraints (fast-tier self-improvement) |
| 1     | `holistic-analysis`    | Optional  | Multi-domain execution-path tracing           |
| 1     | `code-quality`         | Optional  | Design-quality review (informs the plan)      |
| 1     | `optimize-approach`    | Optional  | Default-on approach-optimality check (`--no-optimize` to skip); adopted proposals trigger a bounded re-plan |
| 1     | `confidence`           | **Required** | Plan gate (>= 90% to proceed)              |
| 2     | `aw-create-plan`       | Optional  | Writes `.agent/{branch}/plan.md`              |
| 3     | `tdd`                  | Optional  | RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for pure logic / business rules |
| 3     | `ux`                   | Optional  | UI / accessibility review when UI files touched |
| 3     | `code-quality`         | Optional  | End-of-Phase-3 code-quality pass              |
| 4 (UI)| `aw-tester` *(agent)*  | Optional  | Spec-driven UI verification — dispatched before lint/type/test when `specs.md` + aw-target exist |
| 4     | `confidence`           | Optional  | `analysis` at iteration cap (3 Lite / 5 Full) |
| 4     | `holistic-analysis`    | Optional  | Step-back analysis after stuck-loop confidence |
| 5     | `docs update`          | Optional  | Self-improving doc loop (keeps `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/` in sync) |
| 6     | `review-loop` *(skill)* | Optional  | Post-draft convergence loop — `pr-reviewer` (self-relation) → `implement-suggestion --resolve-all` → `polish simplify`, up to 5 iterations, converging until every review thread is resolved (fix or reply); dispatched by `create-pr` after the draft PR is open |
| 6     | `aw-create-walkthrough` | Optional  | Writes `.agent/{branch}/walkthrough.md`      |
| 6     | `create-pr`            | Optional  | Narrative PR description + push + open draft PR + review-loop + watch |
| 4     | `lorekit-memory`       | Optional  | Writes a lesson at stuck-loop escalation (`memory.write loop::aw-lessons`) |
| 7     | `ci-auto-fix`          | Optional  | Diagnose + fix failed CI checks               |
| 7     | `lorekit-memory`       | Optional  | End-of-run: writes durable run lessons; suggests promotion when `seen_count >= 3` |
| 7     | `review-loop` *(skill)* | Optional  | After CI green: bounded `pr-reviewer` → `implement-suggestion --resolve-all` → `polish simplify` convergence (self-relation; `pr-reviewer` detects authorship automatically via `REVIEW_RELATION`); up to 5 iterations, converging until every review thread is resolved (fix or reply) |

**`confidence` at Phase 1 is the only non-removable companion.** Without it,
the plan gate is gone and the workflow loses its primary safety mechanism.

`review-loop` is a **skill**, not an agent — see
[`rules/companion-skills.md#agent-companions`](./rules/companion-skills.md#agent-companions)
for the agent-companion dispatch contract (currently `feature-pr-verifier`).
Like every other companion, `review-loop` **skips silently** if its definition
file isn't present — the workflow logs one line and continues.

---

## Disabling Companions

Two ways to disable a companion:

### 1. Edit `rules/companion-skills.md` + remove invocation

Best for permanent project-level customization:

1. Open [`rules/companion-skills.md`](./rules/companion-skills.md).
2. Delete the row for the companion you want to remove.
3. Open the relevant `rules/phase-N-*.md` and remove the
   `Skill("<name>")` invocation block (the file is referenced from each
   row's "Disable by" link).
4. Commit. Future runs in this project will skip the companion.

### 2. Remove individual symlinks after install

Best for per-machine or one-off customization. After running
`bash scripts/sync-symlinks.sh --aw`, delete the symlink for any companion
you don't want:

```bash
# Drop tdd and ux from this machine's install
rm ~/.claude/skills/tdd ~/.claude/skills/ux
```

Re-running `bash scripts/sync-symlinks.sh --aw` would re-create them, so commit
to the removal: either don't re-run, or edit the `AW_SKILLS` list in
[`scripts/sync-symlinks.sh`](../../../scripts/sync-symlinks.sh) to drop them
permanently.

When the workflow tries to invoke the missing companion, Claude will return an
error and the workflow will log:

> `companion: <name> — not available, continuing`

…and continue without it. This is by design.

The only exception is `confidence` at Phase 1 — if it's missing, the workflow
stops and asks you to install it before proceeding.

See [`rules/companion-skills.md`](./rules/companion-skills.md) for full
trigger conditions and per-row disable instructions.

---

## Workflow Tiers

The `aw` dispatcher picks one of three tiers (when in doubt, the heavier one).

### Full (complex changes, 4+ files / unfamiliar)

Planner → `plan.md` → executor (the split). Generates artifacts under
`.agent/{branch-name}/`:

- `plan.md` — implementation strategy, decisions, progress log (single
  source of truth)
- `checks.yaml` — one executable check per acceptance criterion; Phase 4's
  mechanical termination condition (definitions immutable to the executor)
- `walkthrough.md` — final summary generated at Phase 6

### Lite (simple changes, 2-3 files)

Single-pass (no planner/executor split). No artifact files; plan exists only in
conversation. Phase 0, Phase 2, Phase 5 (`docs update`), and Phase 6
(`create-pr`) still required.

### Micro (1-file mechanical: typo / copy / version-or-config bump)

Single-pass, planning and quality companions skipped. Phase 0 (quick confirm),
Phase 2 (worktree), and Phase 6 (`create-pr`) still required; docs only if they
drift. The "skip planning when it's trivial" tier.

### Decision Guide

| Tier   | Files / shape                     | Artifacts | Planner split | Worktree |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Micro  | 1 file, mechanical                | No        | No (single-pass) | Yes   |
| Lite   | 2-3 files, simple logic           | No        | No (single-pass) | Yes   |
| Full   | 4+ files OR complex / unfamiliar  | Yes       | Yes           | Yes      |

## Migration Note: `.gw/` → `.agent/`

Earlier versions of this workflow stored artifacts under `.gw/{branch}/`.
**As of v3.0.0, artifacts live under `.agent/{branch}/`** to align with the
`~/.agents/skills/` cross-tool discovery convention used by Codex, Cursor,
OpenCode, and other Agent Skills–compatible clients.

| Old path                          | New path                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `.gw/{branch}/plan.md`            | `.agent/{branch}/plan.md`             |
| `.gw/{branch}/walkthrough.md`     | `.agent/{branch}/walkthrough.md`      |

Add `.agent/` to your repo's `.gitignore`. Existing `.gw/` directories are
untouched — only new artifacts land in `.agent/`. Migrate manually with
`git mv .gw .agent` if desired.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Tier detection FIRST** — Micro vs Lite vs Full before any other action.
2. **Phase 0 and Phase 2 are MANDATORY** — never skip validation or worktree.
3. **`checks.yaml` is the living contract; `plan.md` is the handoff document**
   in Full Mode (both generated by `aw-create-plan`).
4. **Verify after editing** — fast check before continuing.
5. **Stuck-loop cap is mode-aware** — 3 iterations (Lite) / 5 iterations (Full); at
   the cap, run `confidence(analysis)` and auto-replan or escalate.
6. **Companions skip silently** — never block on a missing companion (except
   `confidence` at Phase 1).
7. **Stop and ask when blocked** — don't guess on ambiguity. A `blocking`
   missing-information gap halts even under `--no-confirm`.
8. **Plans are grounded, traceable, and executable** (Full Mode) — every
   planned `create` carries a recorded reuse-search verdict, every user-stated
   requirement maps to an `AC-{n}` criterion, and `checks.yaml` lets Phase 4
   gate on runnable checks instead of judgment. All-green checks are
   necessary, never sufficient.
9. **User-requested changes are never scope creep** — a change the user asks
   for is a new requirement, welcome at any lifecycle point, including **after
   the work is "done"**. Post-completion improvements are folded in (re-detect
   the tier for the delta, reuse the existing branch/PR), never refused as
   out-of-scope. The scope-creep guard restrains only the agent's *own*
   unrequested expansion.

---

## Usage

After installing, trigger autonomous execution with natural language:

```
"Implement dark mode toggle independently"
"Add user authentication feature end-to-end"
"Handle this in isolation — refactor the API client to use retry logic"
```

You can also invoke explicitly: `@autonomous-workflow implement X`.

---

## Self-Improvement

The workflow improves across runs through a **two-tier loop** (full contract:
[`rules/self-improvement-loop.md`](./rules/self-improvement-loop.md)).

### Fast tier — episodic lessons (LoreKit)

When LoreKit's `memory.*` tools are connected (via the `lorekit-memory` skill),
the workflow **reads** accumulated `loop::aw-lessons` lessons before planning
(Phase 1) and **writes** new ones when it gets stuck (Phase 4) or finishes
(Phase 7). Lessons live in **two LoreKit scopes, used together**:

- **Universal lessons** go to the `global` scope. These follow the user across
  every repository — a lesson captured in repo A biases the next run in repo B.
  Always read; default write target.
- **Project-bound lessons** go to the `repo::{owner}/{repo}` scope. Where a
  `repo::` lesson physically lives — LoreKit's hosted server (`remote`, the
  default) or a local `.lorekit/` directory, and whether it commits/syncs — is
  LoreKit's own control model (`lorekit doctor`). There is no filesystem opt-in
  ceremony: the workflow just picks the scope; LoreKit decides storage.

The workflow classifies each candidate lesson at write time: a `trigger-context`
that references a repo path / repo-specific package / domain term → project-bound
(`repo::`); a glob, framework name, or task type with no repo binding → universal
(`global`). When ambiguous, default to universal (`global`).

Lessons carry the LoreKit tag `loop::aw-lessons` and a key in the
`aw-lessons::<slug>` namespace, so the loop's lessons stay separate from other
loops' on the same scopes. Lessons are **advisory** — they bias the plan
(applied like Acceptance Criteria), never silently change a gate. The fast tier
is fully optional: disconnect LoreKit and it degrades to nothing. Lessons expire
(default 90 days, in the lesson body) and the read step ignores expired ones, so
a wrong lesson decays instead of entrenching — LoreKit owns storage and dedups
on write, so there is no INDEX to consolidate.

### Slow tier — retrospective diagnosis

If the workflow ships incorrect code despite all gates passing — or a
post-merge bug traces back to a missed check, or a lesson recurs
`seen_count >= 3` — invoke
`/create-skill diagnose autonomous-workflow` **while the failing session is
still in context**. It does not run the phases. It analyses the failed run,
classifies the failure against this skill's taxonomy, walks every phase to
find the earliest gate that could have caught it, and emits a unified diff
against **this skill's source** so the same failure class cannot recur.

```
/create-skill diagnose autonomous-workflow
/create-skill diagnose autonomous-workflow --symptom "tests passed but didn't import the SUT"
/create-skill diagnose autonomous-workflow --apply        # apply the proposed diff locally (asks first)
/create-skill diagnose autonomous-workflow --pr           # open a PR upstream against agent-skills.git
```

Output lands at `.agent/{branch}/diagnose-autonomous-workflow-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.md`
and is self-contained — another user can read the report, run `git apply` on
the embedded diff, and inherit the improvement without access to the original
session.

`create-skill` owns the generic procedure (seven steps + confidence gate +
apply / PR flow); this skill owns its [diagnostic surface](./rules/diagnostic-surface.md)
(phase model, failure taxonomy, existing-guards table, hard invariants).
Diagnose Mode never modifies user product code — it only proposes changes
to this skill's source.

> **Migrating from v3.6:** the old `/autonomous-workflow --diagnose` flag
> was removed in v3.7. Replace any saved invocations with
> `/create-skill diagnose autonomous-workflow`. Behavior is unchanged.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use when:**

- Complete feature implementation from requirements to PR
- Autonomous task execution with minimal human intervention
- Isolated worktree-based development
- Self-validating implementation with continuous iteration

**Do NOT use for:**

- Interactive coding sessions (use conversational mode)
- Exploratory research tasks (use the explore agent)
