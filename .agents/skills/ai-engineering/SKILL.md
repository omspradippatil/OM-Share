# AI Engineering

Prescriptive guidance for building and reviewing LLM/AI applications.
Thirteen orthogonal concerns — load only the rules the current task
needs.

> **This `SKILL.md` is a thin index.** Detailed rules live in
> `rules/*.md` and load on demand.
> Curated source URLs live in `references/primary-sources.md`.
> Date-flagged changes since 2024 live in `references/recent-changes.md`.
> Literal scaffolding lives in `templates/`.

## Mode Detection

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` (first token) and detect the mode:

| Mode       | Default | Trigger                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `guide`    | **yes** | Default. Open question ("how should I …", "what's the best way to …").        |
| `review`   |         | `$0 == "review"`, or a file/path is supplied as `$ARGUMENTS`.                 |
| `design`   |         | `$0 == "design"`, or "scaffold a prompt / system prompt / eval".              |

State the detected mode and the area(s) in scope before continuing:

```
Mode: review
Areas: prompt-writing, system-prompt-design
Targets: src/agents/triage.ts (system prompt at L24-78)
```

## Area Routing

Map the user's request to one or more rule files.
Load **only** the rules listed for the matched area(s).

| Area                            | Rule file                                                                          | Load when                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Retrieval-augmented generation  | [`rules/rag.md`](./rules/rag.md)                                                   | Chunking, embeddings, hybrid search, reranking, query rewriting.                     |
| Agents & tool use               | [`rules/agents-and-tools.md`](./rules/agents-and-tools.md)                         | Tool schemas, agent loops, parallel tool calls, error recovery, workflow vs agent.   |
| Resilience                      | [`rules/resilience.md`](./rules/resilience.md)                                     | Rate limits (429), retries with jitter, circuit breakers, fallback chains, timeouts, idempotency. |
| Memory & long-running state     | [`rules/memory-and-state.md`](./rules/memory-and-state.md)                         | Conversation summarisation, structured memory, vector memory, memory tools, compaction. |
| Model migration & versioning    | [`rules/model-migration.md`](./rules/model-migration.md)                           | Pin snapshots vs aliases, A/B a new model, deprecations, cross-provider migration, rollback. |
| Evaluation                      | [`rules/evals.md`](./rules/evals.md)                                               | Golden sets, LLM-as-judge, regression CI, error analysis.                            |
| Testing (engineering)           | [`rules/testing.md`](./rules/testing.md)                                           | Unit/integration tests, mocks, VCR cassettes, snapshot tests, CI cost discipline.    |

`evals.md` covers product-quality measurement (golden sets, LLM-as-judge).
`testing.md` covers engineering-correctness tests (mocks, VCR, snapshots).
Load both when the user asks "how do I test this?" without specifying.

**Observability composition.**
When the area is `Observability & versioning` and the task involves OTEL
wiring or attribute naming, invoke the dash0 OTEL skills via `Skill()`
**before** answering — they hold the source of truth for spans and
`gen_ai.*` semconv:

- `Skill("otel-instrumentation", ...)` — SDK setup, exporters, span shape.
- `Skill("otel-semantic-conventions", ...)` — attribute naming and
  spec validation.

If neither skill is in the available-skills list, fall back to the
inline guidance in `rules/observability-and-versioning.md` and the OTEL
spec.

If the user does not name an area, ask one batched clarifying question
listing the thirteen options before loading rules.

---

## Workflow

### `guide` (default)

1. Identify the area(s) from the user's request (use the table above).
2. Load the matched rule file(s).
3. Answer using the rules.
   Cite the source URLs from `references/primary-sources.md` when a claim
   is non-obvious or model-version-specific.
4. If the rule references a date-flagged change, also load
   [`references/recent-changes.md`](./references/recent-changes.md) and
   call out the date in the answer.

### `review`

1. Read the target file(s) supplied in `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. Detect which areas the file touches (prompt strings, system prompts,
   tool schemas, retrieval pipelines, eval scripts, …).
3. Load the matching rule file(s).
4. Produce findings as a numbered list, each with:
   - **What** — the issue, with `path:line`.
   - **Rule** — the rule file + section that's violated.
   - **Fix** — concrete change, with a code snippet when ≤ 10 lines.
5. End with a "Top 3 fixes" prioritised by impact.

Do not edit the file in `review` mode unless the user asks for fixes.

### `design`

1. Confirm the artefact: prompt, system prompt, or eval rubric?
2. Ask the user — in **one** message — for:
   - The task the prompt drives.
   - The model family (Claude / GPT / Gemini / open).
   - Any hard constraints (latency budget, output schema, refusal scope).
   - Whether tool use is in scope.
3. Load the relevant rule(s) and the matching template:
   - System prompt → [`templates/system-prompt-skeleton.md`](./templates/system-prompt-skeleton.md).
   - Tool definition → [`templates/tool-description.md`](./templates/tool-description.md).
   - Eval rubric → [`templates/eval-rubric.md`](./templates/eval-rubric.md).
   - Golden-set seed → [`templates/golden-set.md`](./templates/golden-set.md).
4. Fill in the template.
   Annotate **why** each section exists (one inline comment per section,
   not a full essay).

## Core Principles

1. **Stable-prefix everything.**
   The single highest-leverage optimisation across cost, latency, and
   determinism is keeping the prompt prefix byte-identical across calls
   so it caches.
   Order: `tools → system → stable context → volatile context → user input`.
2. **Match the technique to the model class.**
   Reasoning models (o3, o4, Claude with adaptive thinking) regress under
   added chain-of-thought; non-reasoning models often need it.
   See `rules/prompt-writing.md`.
3. **Workflows beat agents until they don't.**
   A predefined control flow is cheaper, faster, and more debuggable than
   a model-driven loop.
   Build an agent only when the trajectory genuinely cannot be enumerated.
4. **Evals before optimisation.**
   You cannot tell whether a prompt change is an improvement without a
   golden set + regression run.
   Without traces in production, you have no eval inputs.
5. **Defence-in-depth for prompt injection.**
   OWASP LLM01:2025 ranks prompt injection #1.
   Layer input classifier + least-privilege tools + human approval on
   destructive actions + output validator.
   No single guardrail is sufficient — guardrail LLMs are themselves
   injectable.
6. **Right-size the model.**
   Route 60% Haiku-class / 30% Sonnet-class / 10% Opus-class with
   confidence-gated escalation.
   Uniform-Opus is rarely the right answer.
7. **Prompts are code.**
   Versioned in-repo, diffed in PR, gated by CI evals, A/B released.
   Anonymous prompt edits in production dashboards are a regression
   waiting to happen.
8. **Pin model snapshots in production.**
   Aliases auto-upgrade silently — the model that passed evals
   yesterday is not the model serving traffic today.
   See `rules/model-migration.md`.
9. **Plan for the failure modes, not the happy path.**
   Rate limits, provider outages, and tail latency hit every prod
   system.
   Honour `Retry-After`, jitter retries, fall back across models,
   key destructive tool calls for idempotency.
   See `rules/resilience.md`.

## Anti-patterns (one-liners — full coverage in each rule)

- "Be helpful and detailed" instructions — non-actionable.
- Volatile content (timestamps, user IDs) before stable content — kills caching.
- Adding "let's think step by step" to a reasoning model — measurable regression.
- Flipping `tools`, `tool_choice`, or `thinking` mid-conversation — silent cache flush.
- Vector-only retrieval (no BM25) — misses exact-string matches (IDs, error codes).
- Passing the top-20 chunks to the LLM without reranking — wastes tokens, dilutes attention.
- Single-judge LLM evals using the same model as the actor — silent self-preference inflation.
- Tool descriptions written for humans — agents pick the wrong tool.
- Building a multi-agent system before single-agent + workflow exhausts the design space.
- Toggling extended thinking mid-turn — invalidates the entire cached prefix.
- Sending full-resolution screenshots — resize to ≤ 1568 px first.
- Retrying on 429 without honouring `Retry-After` — wastes quota and triggers thundering herds.
- Pure exponential backoff with no jitter — every client retries at the same instant.
- Side-effectful tool calls without idempotency keys — retries double-charge.
- Model aliases (`claude-sonnet-4-7`) in production — auto-upgrade silently.
- Migrating models without a full golden-set run — regressions ship undetected.
- Truncating long conversations instead of summarising — drops context the model needs.
- Cross-user memory leakage — let the model fill in `user_id` and you have a privacy bug.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Mode and areas stated up front.
- [ ] Only the matched rule file(s) loaded.
- [ ] Each finding cites `path:line` and the rule it violates.
- [ ] Source URLs cited when claims are model-version-specific or recent.
- [ ] In `design` mode, the produced artefact uses the matching template.
- [ ] In `review` mode, findings are prioritised; no edits without consent.
