## Overview

Validation checkpoints, resource limits, and rollback procedures for the
autonomous workflow. These guardrails prevent runaway execution and enable
clean recovery.

## Validation Checkpoints (per Phase)

| Phase | Gate / Checkpoint                                                                                  |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Tier selected (Micro / Lite / Full). User confirmed understanding. No unresolved `blocking` missing-information item — even under `--no-confirm`. |
| 1     | Plan matches requirements. `Skill("confidence", "plan")` >= 90% (mandatory companion, Full Mode only — Lite and Micro have no `plan.md`). Every `[user-stated]` requirement covered by an Acceptance Criterion; every planned `create` has an Existing Code Survey verdict. |
| 2     | Worktree created with `gw add` (or native `git worktree add` fallback). CWD is the worktree. Deps installed. `plan.md` + `checks.yaml` written under `.agent/{branch}/` (Full Mode). |
| 3     | Working in isolated worktree. Build/lint passes after each edit. `code-quality(code)` run at end.  |
| 4     | All tests pass AND every `checks.yaml` check passes (or `unsatisfiable` user-approved) OR user-approved stop after stuck-loop escalation. |
| 5     | Docs reflect changes. `Skill("docs", "update --auto")` run.                               |
| 6     | `pr-reviewer` dispatched via `review-loop` (`--critical`; self mode; read-only — findings applied by `implement-suggestion`); blocking findings resolved. Walkthrough shown. Draft PR opened via `Skill("create-pr")`. |
| 7     | CI green OR user-approved stop. Optional `gw remove` (or `git worktree remove` + `git branch -d`) after merge. |

See each `phase-N-*.md` rule for full gate details.

## Self-Validation Questions

| After Phase | Ask                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 1     | Can I explain the approach in 2 sentences?       |
| Phase 2     | Is `git worktree list` showing the new worktree? (or `gw list` if `gw` is installed) |
| Phase 3     | Does code compile and lint pass?                 |
| Phase 4     | Are ALL tests passing (or stop user-approved)?   |
| Phase 5     | Do docs match the implementation?                |
| Phase 6     | Is the PR description accurate and walkthrough shown? |
| Phase 7     | Are CI checks green (or escalation explicit)?    |

---

## Stuck-Loop Limit (Phase 4)

**Mode-aware cap: 3 iterations (Lite Mode) / 5 iterations (Full Mode) on the same failing area.**

| Mode      | Cap | At cap                                                                                  |
| --------- | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lite Mode | 3   | Stop. Run `Skill("confidence", "analysis")`. Auto-replan or escalate to user.       |
| Full Mode | 5   | Stop. Run `Skill("confidence", "analysis")`. Auto-replan or escalate to user.       |

The mode-aware cap is the single biggest cost-saver in the workflow. More
than the cap on the same failing area almost always means the mental model
is wrong — continuing burns tokens without converging.

See [companion-skills.md#stuck-loop-protocol-phase-4](./companion-skills.md#stuck-loop-protocol-phase-4) for the full auto-replan protocol.

---

## Executable-Check Integrity (Phase 4)

Full Mode gates Phase 4 on `.agent/{branch}/checks.yaml`. Verifier-driven
loops invite gaming — agents demonstrably hardcode expected outputs, edit
tests, and exploit weak comparisons to force green. These rules are
**non-relaxable** (full loop in
[`phase-4-testing.md#executable-checks-loop`](./phase-4-testing.md#executable-checks-loop)):

| Rule | Detail |
| ---- | ------ |
| Definitions are executor-immutable | Only `status:` flips freely. `run:`/`setup:` amendments require a `check-run-amended` Progress Log entry. `id:`/`requirement:`/`ears:`/`expect:` — never. A diff touching them is a hard stop. |
| Four forbidden strategies | Never green a check by modifying tests/checks, overloading comparisons, recording/replaying state, or special-casing the check's inputs. |
| Abort affordance | A check unsatisfiable-as-specified gets `status: unsatisfiable` + user escalation with evidence — never a workaround. |
| Necessary, not sufficient | All-green checks never waive the test suite, `pr-reviewer` dispatch, or Phase 7 verifier. |

---

## Tool Prerequisites

| Tool   | Status        | Behavior if missing                                                       |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gh`   | **REQUIRED**  | Stop. Phase 6 (PR creation) and Phase 7 (CI gate) cannot proceed.         |
| `gw`   | Recommended   | Continue with native `git worktree` fallback; emit one-time warning. See [prerequisites#fallback-to-native-git-worktree](./prerequisites.md#fallback-to-native-git-worktree). |

**`gw` is NOT a hard prerequisite.** The workflow falls back to native
`git worktree` when `gw` is missing. Only `gh` is hard-required.

## Companion-Skill Safety

| Companion           | Safety-critical? | Behavior if missing                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `confidence` (Phase 1) | **Yes** — the Full Mode plan gate (Lite/Micro have no `plan.md` and skip it) | Stop, ask user to install before continuing (Full Mode) |
| All other companions  | No                       | Log one line, continue without              |

**Companions are NOT safety-critical** — the workflow continues without them.
The ONLY non-removable companion is `confidence` at Phase 1.

When a companion is unavailable, log to conversation and `plan.md` Progress
Log:

> `companion: <name> — not available, continuing`

## Resource Limits

### Soft Limits (Guidelines)

- Commits: ~3-10 per feature
- Files changed: ~20 max
- Time: ~1-2 hours

### Hard Limits (Stop and Ask)

| Limit                                  | Action                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| > 50 files changed                     | Scope too large — split PRs     |
| > 3 hours stuck                        | Fundamental issue — escalate    |
| > 100 commits                          | Approach is wrong — escalate    |
| Stuck-loop cap on same failing area (3 Lite / 5 Full) | Run `confidence(analysis)`; one-shot auto-replan or escalate |
| 2 `ci-auto-fix` handoffs on same PR    | Stop, surface failures to user  |

---

## When to Stop and Ask

1. Requirements ambiguous mid-implementation.
2. Fundamental blocker encountered.
3. **Agent-initiated** scope creep detected — *you* are about to expand
   beyond the requested change on your own initiative (a refactor no one
   asked for, a "while I'm here" cleanup, a speculative abstraction). This
   trigger is about restraining **your own** expansion. It is **not** a
   reason to refuse work the **user** asks for — see
   [User-requested changes are never scope creep](#user-requested-changes-are-never-scope-creep) below.
4. Tests reveal misunderstanding.
5. Resource limits approaching.
6. Stuck-loop cap hit (3 iterations in Lite Mode / 5 in Full Mode) and auto-replan already used.
7. Critical companion (`confidence`) unavailable.

### How to Ask

```markdown
"Pausing autonomous execution — need guidance.

**Situation:** [what happened]

**Issue:** [the blocker]

**Options:**

1. [Option A] — [pros/cons]
2. [Option B] — [pros/cons]

**My recommendation:** [which and why]

**Question:** [specific question]

Should I proceed with [recommended] or [alternative]?"
```

### User-requested changes are never scope creep

**Anchor:** `user-requested-changes-are-never-scope-creep`

"Scope creep" is a guard against **you** inventing work. A change the **user**
explicitly asks for is, by definition, in scope — it is a new requirement, not
creep. Never refuse or defer a user-requested change on scope-creep grounds.
This holds at **every** point in the lifecycle, including **after the work is
"done"** (PR opened, control handed back):

- A user proposing an improvement once they can see the **holistic picture of
  the finished feature** is exactly when the best refinements surface — the
  workflow must welcome them, not treat "the task is complete" as a closed door.
- The correct response to a post-completion improvement is to **fold it in**,
  not to reject it. Re-detect the tier **for the delta only** (a one-line copy
  tweak is Micro even if the original feature was Full), then:
  - **Micro / Lite delta** → apply it single-pass on the same branch, commit,
    and push to the existing PR.
  - **Full delta** (architectural, cross-cutting, or 4+ files) → run it through
    the [edit-driven iteration loop](./planner-executor-handoff.md#edit-driven-iteration-loop):
    fold the improvement into `plan.md` + `checks.yaml` as a new version,
    re-clear `confidence(plan)`, then execute the delta.
- You **may** note the scope delta for the user's awareness ("this is beyond
  the original ticket — folding it in as a follow-up commit on this PR"), and
  you **should** still apply the normal gates (the change is verified, tested,
  and reviewed like any other). What you must **not** do is accept the idea and
  then decline to act on it, or bounce it back as out-of-scope. Accepted means
  done.

The one legitimate reason to pause on a user-requested improvement is a genuine
**blocker or conflict** (it collides with an existing constraint, it is
technically infeasible as stated, or it needs a decision only the user can
make) — surface that via [How to Ask](#how-to-ask). Scope size alone is never
that reason.

---

## Quality Gates

**Before each phase transition:**

- Previous phase checklist complete
- Self-validation passed
- No blocking errors
- Clear to proceed

**Before Phase 3 (CRITICAL GATE):**

- Phase 2 complete — worktree created
- Currently in worktree directory (NOT user's original directory)
- Dependencies installed
- Build system works
- `plan.md` written under `.agent/{branch}/` (Full Mode)

**If this gate fails, return to Phase 2.**

---

## Rollback Procedures

```bash
# Undo uncommitted changes
git checkout .

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Return to starting point
git reset --hard origin/main

# Remove worktree entirely
gw remove <branch-name> --force                       # with gw
# or, native fallback:
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH" --force \
  && git branch -D <branch-name>
```

---

## Checkpoint Failure Protocol

If validation fails:

1. Do NOT proceed to next phase.
2. Analyze what went wrong.
3. Fix the issue.
4. Re-validate.
5. Only proceed when validation passes.
