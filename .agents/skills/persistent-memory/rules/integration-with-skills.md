Two patterns are documented. **Pointer-based is the default and the
recommendation** — it matches Claude Code's native progressive
disclosure and pays token cost only when the host skill is loaded.

## Pattern A — Pointer (default)

The host skill (e.g. `parenting`) keeps a one-line block in its
`SKILL.md` that tells the model to load memory for the scope before
proceeding.

The literal snippet to add lives in
[`../templates/pointer-snippet.md`](../templates/pointer-snippet.md).
Drop it near the top of the host skill, under the title:

```markdown
## Persistent Context

Before responding, run `Skill("persistent-memory", "read parenting")`
to load accumulated memory for this scope. The returned INDEX surfaces
relevant entries; load individual entries on demand only.

After the conversation, if any durable fact emerged (a preference, a
routine, a decision), run
`Skill("persistent-memory", "write parenting")` to capture it. The
write pipeline will preview the candidate list before persisting.
```

### Why pointer-based wins for quality / token cost

| Property                  | Pointer                                 | Hook (auto-load)                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| When INDEX loads          | Only when the host skill is invoked     | Every session, even when the scope is irrelevant   |
| Tokens paid               | INDEX (~50–200 lines) per host invoke   | INDEX × N scopes × every session                   |
| Debuggability             | One line, in source                     | Hidden in `.claude/settings.json` + a script       |
| Setup cost                | Add one block to host SKILL.md          | Configure hook, declare scopes, test silently      |
| Failure mode              | Visible — the line is absent            | Silent — the hook fires but content is unused      |

Pointer-based pays the cost where the value is. Hooks pay even when
the user is not asking about the scope.

### Tag-based scope coupling

When the host skill represents a topic (`parenting`), name the
persistent-memory scope identically: `parenting`. The 1-to-1 mapping is
the simplest mental model.

When the host skill is generic (`relationship-coach`) but the user has
multiple relationship scopes (`relationship-anna`, `relationship-john`),
the host skill should accept a `subject` argument and pass it through:

```markdown
## Persistent Context

If invoked with a `subject` argument (e.g. `anna`), run
`Skill("persistent-memory", "read relationship-<subject>")`. Otherwise
ask the user which subject this conversation is about before proceeding.
```

## Pattern B — SessionStart hook (opt-in, advanced)

A SessionStart hook auto-loads a configured INDEX into every session.
Use this **only** when the user explicitly wants always-on context for
a small number of scopes (e.g. a personal-assistant scope).

Steps (the user must opt in deliberately):

1. Pick scope names that should auto-load (cap: 2 — more than that
   bloats every session).
2. Add a SessionStart hook in `.claude/settings.json` (or
   `~/.claude/settings.json` for cross-project):

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "SessionStart": [
         {
           "command": "cat ~/.agent-memory/personal/INDEX.md ~/.agent-memory/parenting/INDEX.md"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. Re-confirm the cost: each INDEX runs about 50–200 lines. Two scopes
   could add ~400 lines of permanent context per session.

The skill itself does not install this hook automatically. The
documentation for `/update-config` covers hook installation; refer the
user there.

### When to choose hook over pointer

- The user wants a personal-assistant feel where memory is always
  present.
- There is one or two scopes that genuinely matter every session.
- The user has audited the INDEX size and is comfortable with the
  token spend.

If any of these conditions is uncertain, use pointer-based.

## Two-way handshake: write after a session

The pointer block also tells the host skill to call `write` at the
**end** of the conversation. Pseudo-flow:

1. Host skill starts.
2. Host skill calls `Skill("persistent-memory", "read <scope>")`.
3. INDEX content is now in context. Host responds to the user.
4. Conversation continues.
5. Before the host's final response, host calls
   `Skill("persistent-memory", "write <scope>")`.
6. `write` extracts candidates from the conversation, shows the
   preview, persists with user approval.

This is what makes the loop persistent: read at the start, write at
the end.

### Worked example: the `aw-lessons` self-improvement loop (now on LoreKit)

`autonomous-workflow` is a real consumer of this read-at-start / write-at-end
handshake — but it runs the handshake on **LoreKit**, not on this skill's
markdown store (see [`scaling-tiers.md`](./scaling-tiers.md#lorekit--the-self-improvement-loop-backend)
for the implementation details). It reads the `loop::aw-lessons` lessons
narrow-to-broad (`memory.list` on `repo::{owner}/{repo}` then `global`) before
planning (Phase 1) and writes a lesson when it gets stuck (Phase 4) or finishes
(Phase 7) via `memory.write`. A universal lesson lands in `global`, so a lesson
captured while working in repo A biases the next run in repo B — the workflow's
learning is per-user, not per-repo. The lessons are **procedural** ("what to do
better next time"), and a lesson that recurs (`seen_count >= 3`) is promoted
into the skill's own source through a separate confidence-gated step (the slow
tier — the only path that ships a lesson to every other consumer of the skill).
Two things make this a safe pattern worth copying:

1. **Autonomous writes skip consent but never the privacy pre-flight** — the
   workflow runs unattended, so it cannot pause per write, but secrets / PII
   are still refused outright (a candidate lesson containing a credential is
   dropped, not written).
2. **Lessons are advisory** — they bias the host's behavior, they never
   silently change one of its gates. Behavior changes go through an explicit,
   gated promotion step. This is the entrenchment guard the Reflexion
   research warns is mandatory.

See [`../../../workflow/autonomous-workflow/rules/self-improvement-loop.md`](../../../workflow/autonomous-workflow/rules/self-improvement-loop.md)
for the full contract.

**Lesson-scope schema contract.** The loop lessons (tags `loop::aw-lessons`,
`loop::aw-tester-lessons`, `loop::fix-bug-lessons`, `loop::batch-lessons`,
`loop::reviewer-lessons`, `loop::implement-suggestion-lessons`,
`loop::ci-auto-fix-lessons`, `loop::e2e-pr-stabilizer-lessons`,
`loop::test-auto-fix-lessons`, `loop::optimize-approach-lessons`,
`loop::ideate-lessons`) carry an extended entry schema with five mandatory
fields (`phase`, `trigger-context`, `seen_count`, `status`, `expires`), defined
on this skill's side in [`write-pipeline.md`](./write-pipeline.md#lesson-scope-entries)
and templated at [`../templates/lesson-entry.md`](../templates/lesson-entry.md).
On LoreKit these fields travel inside the entry's `value` (markdown) as a
`meta:` comment rather than markdown frontmatter, but the fields and their
semantics are identical. The host-skill loops depend on exactly these fields
(recurrence counting, promotion gating, expiry pruning), so any change to the
lesson schema MUST update both the write pipeline's lesson-entry rules and the
host skill's loop rules in the same PR — the two surfaces must never drift.

## When NOT to integrate

Some skills should never call `persistent-memory`:

- One-shot utilities (`changelog`, `resolve-conflicts`, `ci-auto-fix`)
  — they have no durable subject.
- Skills that operate on secrets or credentials (would risk routing
  them through extraction).
- Adversarial or audit skills that should not be biased by prior
  conversations.

If you are unsure whether a host skill should integrate, default to
**no**. Pointer can always be added later; removing context bias once a
host skill has read prior memory is harder.

## Verifying integration

After adding the pointer to a host skill, test it once:

1. Start a fresh conversation.
2. Invoke the host skill on a topic that has at least one memory entry.
3. Confirm the model references the memory in its response.
4. Confirm that `write` runs at the end and surfaces the candidate
   preview.

If either step fails silently, the pointer was not loaded — re-read
the host SKILL.md and confirm the block is above any conditional or
mode-detection logic.
