## Overview

Diagnose Mode is `create-skill`'s retrospective entry point.
It does not scaffold, review, or upgrade.
It analyses a session in which **another skill** executed and produced an unsatisfactory result, identifies which of that skill's phases / gates / companions should have caught the problem, and emits a proposed change to the **target skill's source** so the same class of failure cannot recur.

The procedure is **skill-agnostic**.
The skill-specific knowledge — phase model, failure taxonomy, existing per-phase guards, source path roots — is read from the target skill's own [`rules/diagnostic-surface.md`](./diagnostic-surface.md) at runtime.
Skills that do not declare a surface fall back to the inferred-from-`SKILL.md` path documented at the bottom of this file (with reduced fidelity).

Diagnose Mode never modifies anything autonomously.
It writes one report file and stops.
Any proposed change to the target skill is **gated through `Skill("confidence", "analysis")`** and **always requires explicit user confirmation** before `--apply` runs `git apply`.
If the confidence score is below 90 %, Diagnose Mode runs up to **two refinement iterations** — re-investigating evidence, web-searching authoritative sources, and refining the proposal — to try to clear the gate before bailing out.
If the final score (after refinement) is still below 90 %, `--apply` is **disabled for that report** and the diagnosis becomes a discussion artifact rather than an applyable patch.

Run Diagnose Mode while the failing session is still in context — that is when the agent has the maximum amount of evidence (the target skill's plan/walkthrough/log artifacts, tests, user feedback, transcripts) to attribute the failure to a specific gate.

---

## When to Run Diagnose Mode

Trigger on any of:

- The user observes that a skill produced incorrect or low-quality output despite all gates passing.
- A bug found post-merge traces back to a missed check in a workflow skill.
- A companion (or sub-step) was *not* invoked when it should have been — missing trigger.
- A companion *was* invoked but its gate passed for the wrong reason — false-green.
- The user asks: "why did `<skill>` miss this?", "how could `<skill>` have caught this?", or `/create-skill diagnose <skill>`.

Do **not** run Diagnose Mode for:

- Routine bugs in the user's product code unrelated to a skill's gaps — use `/fix-bug` or `/holistic-analysis` instead.
- Failures in-progress mid-workflow — use the target skill's own stuck-loop or `confidence(analysis)` instead.
- Diagnosis of a skill whose source is not on the local checkout — Diagnose Mode needs to be able to resolve the source path to write a unified diff.

---

## Invocation

```
/create-skill diagnose <target-skill-name>
```

Or via `Skill()`:

```
Skill("create-skill", "diagnose <target-skill-name>")
```

`<target-skill-name>` is the directory name under `skills/` (e.g. `autonomous-workflow`, `fix-bug`) **or** the basename of an agent under `agents/` without the `.md` suffix (e.g. `pr-reviewer`, `bug-fix-verifier`). Step 1 disambiguates by checking both locations.
If omitted, ask the user — do not guess.

### Optional flags

| Flag                 | Effect                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--symptom "<text>"` | Verbatim user description of the failure. Becomes Section 1 of the report.                          |
| `--scope <name>`     | Restrict analysis to a specific phase (`phase-3`), companion (`tdd`), or rule file in the target.   |
| `--apply`            | After report generation, apply the proposed diff to the target skill's local checkout. Confirm first. |
| `--pr`               | After applying locally, open a PR against `agent-skills.git` with the improvement.                  |
| `--no-write`         | Print the report to stdout only — do not write `.agent/{branch}/diagnose-*.md`.                     |

`--apply` and `--pr` modify the **target skill's own source files**, never the user's product code.
Treat them with the same caution as any other source-modifying action — show the diff and ask for confirmation, even in Auto mode.

---

## Procedure

Diagnose Mode is seven steps, plus an optional refinement loop (Step 6.5) when the confidence gate fails.
Each step has a concrete deliverable.
The confidence gate at Step 6 is **mandatory** — there is no path to `--apply` that bypasses it.

### Step 1 — Resolve the diagnostic surface

Diagnose Mode works against **two target kinds**: skills (multi-file directories under `skills/`) and agents (single-file `.md` files under `agents/`, optionally with a sibling `agents/<name>/` directory holding rules).
Both resolve through the same procedure — only the source-root path differs.

Resolve the target's diagnostic surface by trying paths in this fixed order, stopping at the first match. **Skills in this repo live under a category directory (`skills/<category>/<name>/`), so a flat `skills/<name>/` lookup alone will miss them — the glob in step 2 is what makes resolution work here.**

1. **Flat skill candidate** — if `skills/<target-name>/` exists (flat layout / other repos), the target is a skill. Source root: `skills/<target-name>/`.
2. **Category-nested skill candidate** — else glob `skills/*/<target-name>/` (one category level, this repo's layout). If **exactly one** directory matches, that is the source root (e.g. `skills/workflow/fix-bug/`). If **more than one** matches, list them and ask the user which to target — do not guess.
3. **Installed skill candidate** — else if the target is installed but not in the current checkout, try the flat install paths `~/.claude/skills/<target-name>/` then `~/.agents/skills/<target-name>/`, and `readlink -f` to the real source root (the cross-tool symlink chain `~/.claude/skills/...` → `~/.agents/skills/...` → repo resolves to a possibly-nested repo path).
4. **Agent candidate** — else if `agents/<target-name>.md` exists, the target is an agent. Source root: `agents/`. Surface path: `agents/<target-name>/rules/diagnostic-surface.md` (the rules directory sits next to the single-file agent body).
5. **None** — refuse and ask the user to clarify; do not guess. Print every path/glob checked.

In all cases the surface path is `<source-root>/rules/diagnostic-surface.md`. Always `readlink -f` the resolved source root before running `git apply` (the checkout may be reached through the symlink chain above). `git apply` always runs from the resolved source root.

If the surface path does not exist at the matched candidate, fall back to inference (see [Fallback](#fallback-for-skills-and-agents-without-a-diagnostic-surface)) and warn the user once that fidelity is reduced.

The surface gives you the target's:

- **Phase model** — list of phases / steps with their gates and rule files.
- **Failure taxonomy** — known classes (each with an ID like `F1`, `F2`, plus `F-novel`).
- **Existing-guards-per-phase table** — what already runs at each phase.
- **Source root** — the path against which `git apply` is executed (`skills/<category>/<target-name>/` for skills in this repo, or flat `skills/<target-name>/` elsewhere; `agents/` for agents). The surface file itself declares this in its `## Source root` section — trust it over the candidate-matching above when they conflict.
- **Hard invariants** — gates the target marks as load-bearing (the diagnoser is forbidden from proposing relaxations to these without manual user confirmation).

### Step 2 — Evidence collection

Gather every observable that describes what happened:

1. The **user's symptom description** (from `--symptom` or the conversation).
2. The **target skill name** plus its source path resolved in Step 1.
3. The current **branch name** and worktree path of the failing session.
4. Any **artifacts** the target skill produced (`plan.md`, `walkthrough.md`, transcripts, logs) — names declared in the diagnostic surface.
5. The **invocation log** of any companions / sub-steps the target ran (when, with what outcome).
6. Any **diff** between the produced output and what the user says was correct.
7. The **transcript** of any tests, lint runs, CI runs, or judgments that "passed" while the bug was present.
8. **Episodic lessons** — if the surface declares a `## Lessons scope` (the skill's fast-tier self-improvement store), load it from LoreKit with `memory.list { scope: "global", tags: ["loop::<skill>-lessons"] }` (and `repo::{owner}/{repo}`) and pull the entries whose `trigger-context` matches this failure, **prioritising promotion-eligible ones (`seen_count >= 3` or `status: structural`)**. A lesson that already recurred N times is the strongest possible evidence that this is a real, recurring class — not a one-off — and it often already names the phase and the fix in its *"What to do next time"* field. Cite the matched lesson keys and their `seen_count` in the report's Evidence section. Skip silently if no scope is declared or LoreKit's `memory.*` tools are not connected.

If the target ran in a degraded mode (e.g. autonomous-workflow Lite, fix-bug `--analyse-only`) and produced fewer artifacts, note that fact explicitly — it is a contributing factor and the report must call it out.

### Step 3 — Failure classification

Match the symptom against the target's failure taxonomy from the diagnostic surface.
Pick **exactly one** primary class.
If the failure is a novel mode not in the taxonomy, classify it as `F-novel` and propose adding a new taxonomy row to the target's surface file in Step 4.

### Step 4 — Phase-attribution analysis

Walk every phase listed in the target's diagnostic surface.
For each, answer four questions:

1. Did this phase run?
2. Was its gate satisfied or bypassed (and how)?
3. Could a tighter check at this phase plausibly have caught the failure?
4. If yes, what is the **smallest concrete change** that would have caught it?

Output a table — one row per phase — with the answers.
Highlight the phases where (3) is `yes` and (4) is non-trivial.

### Step 5 — Proposed improvement

Construct **one** improvement proposal targeted at the earliest phase where a tighter check would have caught the failure (earliest is better — fail fast, save downstream tokens).

The proposal must contain:

- **Type** — one of: new check in an existing rule, new companion / sub-step, new trigger condition, new gate, taxonomy / registry update.
- **Target file** — full path inside the resolved source root (`skills/<target-name>/` for skills, `agents/` for agents).
- **Concrete edit** — before/after blocks with the exact text to add, change, or remove.
- **Unified diff** — fenced ```diff block in the report, ready to apply with `git apply`.
- **Mechanical vs. judgment** — is the new check rule-based (deterministic) or LLM-judged? Prefer mechanical when possible.
- **Cost** — how many tokens or seconds the new check adds per target-skill run.
- **Validation plan** — how to confirm the change actually catches the failure mode (ideally: a regression test or a worked example placed in `references/` of the target skill).

If the failure was classified `F-novel` in Step 3, the proposal must also include the new row to append to the target's failure-taxonomy table in `rules/diagnostic-surface.md`.

### Step 6 — Confidence gate (MANDATORY)

Run:

```
Skill("confidence", "analysis")
```

Pass the diagnosis as the work-under-review: the symptom, the failure-class, the phase-attribution table, and the proposed edit.
The skill scores how confident it is that the **proposal actually fixes the failure class without weakening other gates**.

| Score   | Meaning                                                                | Effect on `--apply`                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ≥ 90 %  | Proposal is well-grounded; targeted change unlikely to regress others | `--apply` permitted (still asks for confirmation)                                                  |
| 75–89 % | Proposal is plausible but not reliable enough to change skill source  | `--apply` **disabled**; report saved as discussion artifact; user invited to refine the proposal |
| < 75 %  | Proposal is speculative or addresses the wrong root cause             | `--apply` **disabled**; report saved with `status: low-confidence` so it surfaces in audits        |

Record the score and the gate outcome in the report (Section 6 below).
If the score is below 90 %, **do not finalise the report yet** — proceed to Step 6.5 to attempt to raise confidence through additional investigation before recording the final outcome.
If after Step 6.5 the final score is still below 90 %, **the agent does not offer `--apply`** even if the user passed the flag — it states the score, links to the report, and suggests the user iterate on the proposal manually.

This is the load-bearing safety check.
Without it, Diagnose Mode could weaken the target skill's own gates whenever the agent is overconfident in a wrong analysis.

### Step 6.5 — Refinement loop (only if Step 6 returned below 90 %)

When the Step 6 score is below 90 %, run up to **two additional refinement iterations** before finalising the report.
Each iteration is one round of *re-investigate → web-search → refine proposal → re-score*.
Stop the loop the moment the score reaches ≥ 90 %, or after the second iteration — whichever comes first.

For each iteration (cap: **2**):

1. **Re-investigate the evidence.** Re-read the target's diagnostic surface, the artifacts from Step 2, and any transcripts you may have summarised away. Look specifically for signals the first pass under-weighted — phases that ran in degraded mode, gates that were satisfied for the wrong reason, false-green tests.
2. **Authoritative web search.** When the failure mechanism touches a domain you do not have full first-party context on (specific framework idiom, library version semantics, CVE, RFC, vendor behaviour), invoke `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` against authoritative sources (vendor docs, CVE databases, RFCs, project changelogs). Do **not** rely on general intuition or scattered blog posts.
3. **Refine the proposal.** Adjust Step 5 in light of the new evidence. The improvement may shift to an earlier phase, become more mechanical, change its target file, or split into a tighter scope. If the refinement reveals the failure was misclassified in Step 3, update the failure class first, then redo the proposal.
4. **Re-run the confidence gate.** Call `Skill("confidence", "analysis")` again with the refined proposal. Record the new score and the delta from the prior iteration.

Record each iteration in the report's Section 6 iteration-history table so the user can see what was tried and why the score did or did not move.

**Do not loop more than twice.**
Naïve self-refine amplifies bias rather than reducing it past two rounds (see *Pride and Prejudice*, ACL 2024 and SELF-[IN]CORRECT, AAAI); a third pass would compound that risk without adding new evidence.
If the second iteration still returns below 90 %, accept the final score and proceed to Step 7 with the current proposal — the report becomes a discussion artifact rather than an applyable patch.

### Step 7 — Write the report

Write the diagnosis report to:

```
.agent/{branch}/diagnose-{target-skill}.md
```

Re-running Diagnose Mode against the same target overwrites the prior report; check it into version control or copy it aside before re-running if you want to keep the history.

The report is **self-contained** — another user with no access to the original session must be able to read it and apply the improvement.
Use the structure in [Output Artifact](#output-artifact).

If `--no-write` is set, print the report to stdout instead.

### Step 8 — Optional apply / PR (only if Step 6 ≥ 90 %)

If `--apply` is set **and** the Step 6 confidence score is ≥ 90 %:

1. Show the unified diff inline.
2. **Ask the user to confirm.** Always — Auto mode does not bypass this.
3. On confirmation, run `git apply` against the diff inside the target skill's source root.
4. Run any local skill validators the target declares (e.g. `claude plugin validate` if available).
5. Report success or rollback.

If `--apply` is set **but** the Step 6 score is below 90 %:

- Refuse to apply.
- Print the score, the reason, and the path to the report.
- Suggest: "Refine the proposal, run Diagnose Mode again, or apply the diff manually after review."

If `--pr` is also set (still gated on Step 6 ≥ 90 %):

1. Stage the changes locally.
2. Create a feature branch named `diagnose/<target-skill>-<failure-class>-<short-slug>` in the `agent-skills.git` repo.
3. Open a PR titled `<target-skill>: harden against <failure-class>` with the diagnosis report attached as the PR description.
4. **Do not auto-push without confirmation.** Show the branch + PR title and wait for the user.

#### Commit message and PR body rules

The commit message and PR body describe **the change itself** — what rule was added, why it is load-bearing, what failure class it prevents — and nothing more.

- **Never add an `Origin:` footer.** Lines like `Origin: diagnose-mode run against PR <org>/<repo>#<n>` are forbidden in commit messages, PR bodies, and the diagnosis report.
- **Never add a provenance / attribution footer.** No `Generated by /create-skill diagnose`, no `Diagnosed from session …`, no `Source: PR #…`, no `Co-authored with diagnose mode`. The reader cannot act on this metadata, and downstream reviewers (who did not run the diagnose session) read it as noise or — worse — as an instruction to chase a link they have no context for.
- **Never reference the originating PR, ticket, or session.** If the failure was observed in `org/repo#1234`, the commit and PR must still stand on their own: describe the failure class generically, cite the rule file path, and let the diagnosis report (which lives separately at `.agent/{branch}/diagnose-*.md`) hold the session-specific evidence.
- **The diagnosis report stays out of the commit.** Do not paste the report into the commit message. The PR body MAY include the report verbatim (per Step 8.3 above) because the PR is the discussion surface; the commit message is the durable record and must read cleanly on `git log` years later, with no dead links to closed PRs in other repos.

Write commit messages in the same conventional-commits voice as the rest of the repo (`fix(<scope>): …`, `feat(<scope>): …`) and let the body explain the *why* in the present tense. Anything that answers "where did this diff come from?" belongs in the diagnosis report, not the commit.

## Output Artifact

The diagnosis report uses plain Markdown — no YAML frontmatter.
The metadata header at the top is parseable enough for any future tooling, and skips the ceremony.

```markdown
# Diagnosis: <one-line failure summary>

## 7. Validation plan

- How to confirm the new check catches the failure: <steps>
- Optional: a regression worked-example to add under `references/` in the target skill

## 8. Sharing

- Apply locally: `cd <source-root> && git apply <path-to-this-report>` where `<source-root>` is `skills/<target>/` for skills or `agents/` for agents (or use `--apply` if Section 6 permitted it)
- Open a PR: `--pr` flag (also gated on Section 6 ≥ 90 %), or manually with the diff above
```

If a future user wants machine-readable metadata, the header is regular enough to grep — and a real consumer can be added later without breaking past reports.

---

## Applying the Proposed Change

`--apply` is gated on **two** preconditions, in order:

1. **Step 6 confidence ≥ 90 %.** If the gate failed, `--apply` is refused — the agent prints the score and the report path and stops.
2. **Explicit user confirmation.** Even with the gate passing, the agent must show the diff and ask before running `git apply`.

When both preconditions are met:

1. Print the unified diff to the conversation.
2. Ask for confirmation. Auto mode does not bypass this.
3. On confirm: extract the diff block from the report and run `git apply` from the resolved source root (`skills/<target-skill>/` for skills, `agents/` for agents).
4. If `git apply` fails, fall back to manual `Edit` / `Write` based on the Before/After blocks. Treat any difference between the diff and the actual edit as a fresh decision and re-confirm.
5. Report which files changed.

When the agent operates from a copy of the target that is not a checked-out repo (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/<target>/` or `~/.claude/agents/<target>.md` symlinked to a read-only path), `--apply` resolves the real source via `readlink -f` first.

---

## Sharing the Improvement Upstream

The diagnosis report is designed to be shareable.
Other users improve their local skill in two ways:

1. **Receive a report file** — drop the `diagnose-*.md` into their `agent-skills.git` checkout and run `git apply` on the embedded diff.
2. **Pull an upstream PR** — when `--pr` is used, the PR carries the report as its description and the diff as its commit, so any user who pulls the merged change inherits the fix.

The report is intentionally provider-neutral: another agent harness (Codex, Cursor, OpenCode) can read the report, apply the diff, and benefit from the improvement without needing this Claude Code session.

---

## Hard Rules

- **Diagnose Mode never modifies user product code.** It only proposes changes to the target skill's own source.
- **Diagnose Mode never auto-applies.** `--apply` requires (a) Step 6 confidence ≥ 90 % and (b) explicit user confirmation, in that order. `--pr` requires a successful local apply first. Auto mode does not bypass either check.
- **No `--apply` without confidence.** If `Skill("confidence", "analysis")` returns < 90 % after Step 6.5's refinement loop has had its full two iterations, `--apply` is refused even if the user passed the flag — the report becomes a discussion artifact.
- **Refinement loop is capped at two iterations.** When Step 6 returns below 90 %, Step 6.5 runs at most two rounds of re-investigation + web search + proposal refinement before accepting the final score. Naïve self-refine loops amplify bias past two iterations (per the ACL 2024 / AAAI research cited in Step 6.5); the agent must not exceed the cap by spawning additional rounds, even if the score is trending upward.
- **Every diagnosis cites a taxonomy class.** Either an existing row from the target's surface, or `F-novel` plus a proposed new row. New rows are appended to the target's `rules/diagnostic-surface.md` only when a diagnosis clears the confidence gate AND the user approves the apply.
- **Earliest-phase fix wins.** When multiple phases could have caught the failure, propose the change at the earliest phase — failing fast saves the most tokens.
- **Mechanical checks beat judgment checks.** A deterministic rule that can be evaluated without an LLM call is always preferred over an LLM-judged review step.
- **One proposal per report.** If the analysis surfaces multiple independent gaps, run Diagnose Mode again per gap rather than bundling fixes.
- **The agent does not weaken existing gates.** Proposals that *remove* or *relax* a gate the target's surface marks as a hard invariant require the user to type the change manually — Diagnose Mode will surface the analysis but will not pre-fill an apply diff for a relaxation.
- **Diagnose Mode does not edit `create-skill` itself by default.** Self-diagnosis is allowed but requires the user to pass the target name explicitly (`/create-skill diagnose create-skill`) — there is no path where the diagnoser silently rewrites its own procedure.
- **No `Origin:` footer. No provenance footer. No session attribution.** Commit messages, PR titles, and PR bodies produced by `--apply` / `--pr` must NOT include `Origin: …`, `Generated by /create-skill diagnose …`, `Diagnosed from session …`, `Source: <PR>`, or any other line that says "this came from a diagnose run." The diagnosis report at `.agent/{branch}/diagnose-*.md` is the durable record of provenance; the commit describes the change itself. See [Commit message and PR body rules](#commit-message-and-pr-body-rules) in Step 8 for the full prohibition list.

## Fallback for Skills and Agents Without a Diagnostic Surface

If the target has no `rules/diagnostic-surface.md`, Diagnose Mode degrades gracefully rather than refusing:

1. Read the target body end-to-end (`skills/<target>/SKILL.md` for skills, `agents/<target>.md` for agents).
2. Treat each H2 section that names a phase, step, or stage as a candidate phase row.
3. Use a minimal taxonomy: `F-novel` only.
4. Treat every gate / companion mentioned in the body as an existing guard.
5. Resolve the source root from Step 1's match (`skills/<target>/` for skills, `agents/` for agents).
6. **Print one warning before generating the report**: "No diagnostic surface declared for `<target>` — fidelity is reduced; consider adding `<source-root>/rules/diagnostic-surface.md` (skills) or `agents/<target>/rules/diagnostic-surface.md` (agents) from the template at `skills/authoring/create-skill/templates/diagnostic-surface.template.md`."

The fallback is intentionally low-effort — it exists so a brand-new skill or agent can still be diagnosed before its author has had time to declare a surface.
The right long-term fix is to declare the surface; the report explicitly recommends doing so.
